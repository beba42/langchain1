Key Figures

Management Commentary	7





2024 was a year of change and growth for Flying Tiger Copenhagen. We navigated both new opportunities and challenges, growing our presence around the world, trying out new ideas, and taking meaningful steps toward more sustainable ways of working. In this report, we look back
at the moments and milestones that shaped our year. This year's annual report highlights the key events and achievements that define our progress.
2024 marks a significant milestone in our journey with the opening of our 1,000th store globally. Reaching our 1,000th store is an achievement that fills us with immense
pride but also a deep sense of responsibility. What began in 1995 as a modest surplus goods store in Copenhagen has evolved into a global brand, inspiring joy and creativity in homes and communities across 39 markets. This journey reflects the trust and love our customers have shown us, and for that we are truly humbled and grateful.
Our mission of spreading joy and creativity took an extra leap this year as we entered new markets: Bahrain,
Türkiye, Australia, and Vietnam together with our strong franchise partners. This expansion underscores our belief in the power of creating connections through playful and affordable design.
To better connect with our customers, we introduced the Flying Tiger Copenhagen Club this year with a new app. The app bridges our physical and digital presence, making it easier than ever for customers to explore, shop and connect with us anytime, anywhere. During 2024, the app was launched in seven markets, with more to be added in the near future.
Sustainability remains integral to everything we do. In 2024, we achieved a significant milestone by using eco- fuels for our sea freight, making a substantial impact on our reduction targets. From offering certified products to incorporating sustainability into our design and operational processes, we continue to minimise our
environmental footprint while delivering commercial value to our customers. This achievement has been documented





and recognised by independent assessments from EcoVadis and the Science Based Target initiative, underscoring our commitment to transparency and accountability.
Our positive growth in 2024, with record high EBITDA, provides a solid foundation for 2025. We are optimistic about strengthening customer perceptions of our concept and expanding our franchise network further.
The record Christmas performance in 2024 highlighted that while our core range remains essential, peak seasons are when customers engage most with our stores and webshop. These trends underscore the importance of delivering exceptional value and memorable experiences during key periods of the year.
As we reflect on 2024, we extend our gratitude to our teams, partners and customers, who have contributed to another year in our journey. Together, we have turned challenges into opportunities and vision into reality.
Looking ahead, we remain committed to growing responsibly, innovating boldly and delivering joy to millions of customers worldwide.
Subsequent to the end of 2024, Zebra A/S has undergone significant changes, including the appointment of a new Board of Directors and the completion of a management buy-out by the Executive Management with the support of our banking partners. These developments mark an important transition in our governance and ownership structure, reinforcing our long-term commitment to building a stronger company - including a significantly strengthened capital structure - for the benefit of all stakeholders.
Together, we will continue to build a Flying Tiger Copenhagen that is loved by customers and respected for its positive impact.

Introduction to Flying Tiger Copenhagen
Flying Tiger Copenhagen is a design-led variety retailer, operated by its parent company, Zebra A/S, and headquartered in Copenhagen, Denmark.
All rights related to the Flying Tiger Copenhagen brand are owned by Zebra A/S, which operates stores under three distinct business models. Flying Tiger Copenhagen stores are internationally marketed under a unified brand identity, providing customers with a fun and innovative shopping experience across diverse markets.
With a strong presence in numerous countries, the brand is known for its playful, functional and affordable products that bring a touch of Scandinavian creativity to everyday life.
Our History
It all started in the 1980s at a flea market stall. Our founder, Lennart Lajboschitz, and his wife Suz sold umbrellas there. In 1988, they turned their stall into a small shop called Zebra in their Copenhagen neighbourhood.
The shop became popular for selling affordable items like umbrellas, sunglasses, socks and surplus goods. Later, Zebra led to the opening of Tiger, a new concept store where all items were sold for 10 DKK.
Tiger stores expanded outside Denmark for the first time in 2001, when Iceland welcomed its first store. The brand later became Flying Tiger Copenhagen after undergoing a rebranding in 2016, reflecting its Danish heritage and quirky design philosophy.

Our Business Model
Our retail presence is structured through three distinct operational models: company-owned stores, 50/50 partnerships and franchises.
By combining retail operations at group level with a strong network of franchise partners, we benefit from both worlds. Our own stores give us full control and direct insights, strengthening the brand, enabling rapid innovation, and ensuring consistent execution across key markets. At the same time, our franchise operations provide local agility and extended market reach, allowing us to expand efficiently, tap into regional expertise, and adapt to local conditions with lower operational risk.

Company-Owned Stores
A significant portion of our store network consists of locations that are 100% owned and operated by Zebra A/S. This model allows us to have full control over store operations, ensuring consistency in customer experience, product assortment and brand positioning. By directly managing these stores, we can swiftly implement strategic initiatives, test new concepts and leverage insights to optimise our retail operations.

50/50 Partnerships
In selected markets, we have entered into 50/50 partnership agreements with local partners who bring valuable market expertise and operational insights. Through 50/50 partnerships, we share ownership and responsibilities with our partners, allowing us to leverage local market knowledge while maintaining a strong influence over brand management and operational standards.

Franchise Model
Our franchise model allows us to expand our footprint in diverse markets with minimal investment while ensuring adherence to our brand guidelines. Under this model, professional and international franchise partners operate Flying Tiger Copenhagen stores under our brand name, benefiting from our established reputation, product offerings and operational support. Thanks to local market knowledge and strong operations, the partners and franchise model allow us to reach new regions and customer segments, ensuring brand consistency while adapting to local market dynamics.

A true milestone in terms of our People efforts.


Market Entry in Türkiye
We proudly launched our presence in Türkiye, opening stores in collaboration with local franchise partner Karaca Group. With plans of opening 110 stores by 2028 in this market, the expansion reflects our commitment to offer Turkish shoppers a brand-new retail experience in an already vibrant retail landscape. Notably, this marks the first time we entered a market with fully operational stores, a webshop and an app available from day one. Read more about this event on page 32.

November 2024.

The magical milestone of reaching store number 1,000 represents the global growth our brand has undergone during the past 30 years and ends 2024 on a high note.

We are Flying Tiger Copenhagen
"A richer life doesn't cost a fortune". This simple yet powerful phrase captures the essence of Flying Tiger Copenhagen. Our mission is to create bold, bright products that enrich everyday life - at prices everyone can afford.
"A richer life doesn't cost a fortune" is more than just our tagline - it is both a symbolic and literal guide for everything we do. It reflects our commitment to enriching everyday life with affordable, well-designed products that bring joy and inspiration to all. This guiding principle
influences every aspect of our brand, from the way we design our products to the experience we create in our stores, ensuring that quality and creativity remain accessible to everyone.
To maintain a clear and consistent brand identity across our ever-expanding markets and touchpoints, we have defined six core brand stories. These stories serve as a guiding framework, reflecting who we are, what we stand for, and the key shopping experiences we offer.

Core Narratives
These core narratives shape our brand, ensuring Flying Tiger Copenhagen remains a vibrant and meaningful presence in the lives of our customers.

Brand & Design
Our visual identity plays a crucial role in how people experience the Flying Tiger Copenhagen brand and product design. Consistency is essential, ensuring that every touchpoint reflects our unique style. We visually differentiate our target groups, creating a distinct look and feel for each, whether it is modern seasonal items or colourful everyday essentials.
With a broader range of seasons, occasions, categories and target audiences than most, strong design principles are vital. Every product must be visually appealing while seamlessly fitting into our overall assortment. To achieve this, we have refined and redefined our design principles, ensuring all campaigns align with our strategic direction and six brand stories - creating familiarity and brand recognition.
To stay ahead in a competitive market, innovation is at the core of our product development strategy. We continuously explore emerging trends, consumer
preferences and technological advancements to introduce exciting and relevant products. Our dedicated teams collaborate across departments to ensure a seamless blend of creativity and functionality, delivering products that surprise and delight our customers while keeping
a conscious bill of materials in mind - supervised by our Sustainability team.

Sourcing
In contrast to product selection, design, innovation and development, all mainly carried out in-house, our production is outsourced to external suppliers. While
working under our supervision, they all of course commit to our Supplier Code of Conduct, Social Compliance, our ambitious sustainability and quality targets, and our ethical policies.
We have a long-term strategic partnership with our main suppliers and have defined clear, mutual objectives. We maintain a close dialogue with our suppliers through sourcing operation offices - both to ensure a continued focus on improving our products and to address sustainability issues and social impacts throughout our value chain. A scorecard system allows us to grade each supplier's performance on several parameters. Our supplier base is being constantly optimised, and our supply market is now expanding further into Southeast Asia.
Close monitoring and auditing of tier-1 suppliers and factories provide supply chain transparency.





All products undergo a governance process, including BOM verification, testing programme, certification tracing and assessment of final product quality - all to ensure that suppliers meet and comply with quality and compliance requirements. To ensure optimal product execution in our stores, we have established a cross-functional sales and operations planning process. This process monitors the entire supply chain status and alerts in due time if there are any discrepancies in targets or planning.

Logistics
In 2024, our logistics centres shipped more than 350,000,000 pieces, in all, to our stores. Not
surprisingly, on-time deliveries are vital. Efficient logistics operations are simply highly essential to our business. To ensure scalable, cost-efficient and smooth operations in all our markets around the world, we work with several logistics service providers.
As part of our sustainability ambitions, we made an agreement with Maersk to ensure that 75% of all our containers are shipped within the ECO delivery concept.

Sustainability
Our approach to sustainability is highly data-driven, ambitious and based on the concept of the circular economy. We know that climate change and resource utilisation are extremely pressing topics, and we have developed data, targets, tools and processes to address them. To more deeply understand our carbon footprint, we calculated our full Scope 1-3 CO2 emissions for the first time in 2019 and have been refining our calculations and methodologies ever since. We have set ambitious, science-based reduction targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (scopes 1, 2 and 3). To ensure that our data handling and targets align with the Paris Agreement, we signed up to and were validated by the Science Based Targets initiative in 2021, becoming one of the very first retail companies to do so. In all four of our Science Based Targets we are ahead of trajectory.
We have an overall target to reduce our emission intensity by 30% by 2026*. In terms of both the circular economy and climate change, our focus is primarily on resource utilisation across products, packaging, logistics and stores. We aim to minimise the use of plastic in our products and packaging materials while increasing the use of renewable and highly recyclable materials one item at a time. This ensures both a lower carbon footprint and the use of more circular materials.




Brick-and-Mortar Stores
In 2024, we continued optimising our store network and operations to strengthen our foundation for long-term growth. Our stores, located in high-traffic areas such as busy high streets and popular shopping malls, are leased to minimise upfront investments.
Typically ranging from 150 to 250 m², our stores are designed to feel open and inviting. The simple, maze-like layout encourages customers to explore and discover our full product range. Ambient background music
enhances the welcoming atmosphere, while our signature Scandinavian décor - featuring practical wooden furniture, white walls and warm lighting - puts the spotlight on our products.
Our store employees are vital to delivering a positive




Online Shopping and Omnichannel Approach
Expanding our online presence and omnichannel strategy is a key focus of our growth plan. What began as a small- scale online business in Denmark and Sweden in 2020 has since evolved into a comprehensive e-commerce platform serving most of our markets.
In addition to our e-commerce efforts, social media platforms such as LinkedIn, TikTok, Instagram and Facebook play a crucial role in driving commercial growth and increasing brand awareness. These platforms allow us to connect with diverse audiences, engage in meaningful conversations, and showcase our unique brand personality through creative content and campaigns.




*Base year is 2019. Emission Intensity is calculated as overall kg's of GHG emissions per DKK gross profit.

Our commitment to digital innovation has also led to the launch of the Flying Tiger Copenhagen Club app in 2024. This initiative is a vital part of our omnichannel strategy, aimed at enhancing customer engagement and fostering long-term loyalty. Read more about our new app on page 34.

Our Markets
Not only do we have a strong presence across Europe and Asia Pacific, the Middle Eastern market is growing as well. We own and operate most of our European entities ourselves, i.e. 100% ownership. As part of our
consolidation strategy, we have in recent years increased our share of fully owned entities, enabling us to increase the benefits of scale for the organisation. We will continue to reap these scale benefits in the years ahead, and over time we will strive to consolidate the markets in Europe that are currently not fully owned.
In 2024, we entered four new markets: Bahrain, Türkiye, Vietnam and Australia. This diverse expansion was executed together with franchise partners with strong, strategic positions in the local retail landscape.

Technology & Digital Transformation
Leveraging technology is a crucial part of our long-term growth strategy. Our investments in advanced retail technologies, data analytics and automation tools allow us to enhance operational efficiency and improve the customer experience.
Strengthening our backbone to cost-effectively support and fuel future growth is a strategic imperative for us. In recent decades, our rapid growth has been supported by a flexible and scalable supply chain model, investments in IT infrastructure and a continued strengthening of the organisation and business processes.

Financial and Operating Model
Our Senior Leadership Team oversees the global business operations, ensuring strategic direction and efficiency across all functions. Each senior leader is responsible
for managing and evaluating their respective areas, both individually and in collaboration with the broader organisation. They closely monitor operational and financial performance to drive sustainable growth.





A key focus is optimising our supply chain to maintain low working capital while effectively supporting our stores. To fuel ongoing business development, we continuously work to free up capital by improving inventory management. This includes reducing lead times from purchase to sale and enhancing our forecasting process. These efforts not only strengthen working capital but also improve coordination across the organisation.

People & Culture
Our employees are the backbone of our success. We foster a vibrant and inclusive workplace culture that encourages creativity, collaboration and personal growth. We aim
to empower our employees to take ownership of their roles and contribute to our shared vision. Inclusiveness and responsibility are deeply rooted in our company culture and guide our approach to being an attractive and inspiring workplace.

Communications
Communication is a strategic tool focused on supporting our strategy, reflecting our values. Communications play a central role in supporting PR initiatives and managing stakeholder relations, ensuring coherence, transparency, and engagement in everything we share.
Our efforts aim to strengthen brand positioning, enhance internal culture, and enable long-term value creation through clear, timely, and purpose-driven messaging. This year we established a Corporate Communication function driven from HQ and supported by internal and external resources across markets to ensure consistency and local relevance.

Social Responsibility
Our commitment to making a positive impact extends beyond our products. We actively engage in initiatives that support local communities, promote ethical labour practices and contribute to societal well-being.
From charitable partnerships to employee volunteer programmes, our CSR initiatives align with our mission to enrich lives in a responsible and sustainable manner. Read more about our social responsibility initiatives on page 44.

Annual Report 2024
Operating and
Financial Review 2024





In 2024, the Group generated earnings before interest, tax, amortisation, depreciation, impairment losses and special items (EBITDA before special items) of DKK 1,126m compared to DKK 1,121m in 2023. Revenue in 2024 was DKK 5,218m, which was 5% higher than in 2023. Revenue performance was largely driven by strong product campaigns throughout the year, with exceptional results during the peak seasonal campaigns - particularly Christmas in Q4 - which continues to be the most important trading period for the Group. Profit for the year from continuing operations amounted to DKK 24m, while profit for the year amounted to DKK 6m. Despite supply chain challenges from turmoil in the Red Sea region, the overall performance was the result of disciplined cost control, strong performance in our European markets and a further ramp-up of franchise activities.
The Executive Management and the Board of Directors consider the operational and financial performance of 2024 to be satisfactory and remain positive on the outlook for the future.
In 2024, Flying Tiger Copenhagen advanced the strategic agenda set in 2020 through four cornerstone programmes designed to strengthen and scale the business:
1. Customer & Digital
Enhancing the digital customer experience across all channels to boost engagement and drive omnichannel growth.
2. Merchandise Planning
Improving product allocation and replenishment to ensure the right products are available at the right time in every store.
3. Retail operations



Revenue Development
Total revenue in 2024 was DKK 5,218m, corresponding to an increase of DKK 251m, or 5%, compared to 2023. Our outlook for 2024 targeted a revenue growth of
7-10%, and while we closed the year at +5%, this solid performance reflects our resilience amid global supply chain delays, shifting consumer behaviour, and an increasingly competitive retail landscape. A strong Christmas trade outperformed previous years and was a decisive driver of this growth - once again proving the strength and relevance of our concept during the most critical retail period.
Our three largest markets represented 46% of total revenue, with Italy in front followed by Spain and the United Kingdom.
By the end of 2024, we were operating 889 stores across 28 markets (including our Japanese joint venture).
Including our franchise network, the total number of stores was 1,001.
We continue to optimise our store network and going forward we will pursue a modest expansion of store numbers in Europe, as we still see potential in this region. Our e-commerce platform will also add to
our future growth, and we will continue to implement improvements, creating even better experiences for our customers. However, the most significant future growth will come from our franchise setup in new markets outside Europe. This growth is very scalable in collaboration with strong regional or global franchise partners.

Top markets in 2024

Streamlining store operations through enhanced tools and processes, including continued rollout of self- checkout technology.
4. Franchise growth
Expanding and supporting the franchise network by building a scalable platform to serve current and new franchise partners.

Development in Earnings
In 2024, the gross margin was 62.7% vs. 63.1% in 2023. The slight decrease was expected and due to the different margin profile between our retail business and our growing franchise business. We expect that the slight decrease in gross margin will continue as the franchise business becomes a larger part of the Group.
Operating costs (staff costs and other external expenses) amounted to DKK 2,148m in 2024 compared to DKK 2,037m in 2023 and represent 41.2% of revenue, the same level as in 2023. Despite inflationary pressures in 2024, ongoing cost discipline and the strategic priority of simplifying operations absorbed the inherent cost increase.
EBITDA before special items amounted to DKK 1,126m compared to DKK 1,121m in 2023. The EBITDA margin before special items of 21.6% was on a par with expectations targeted to be in the range 19-23%.
Special items in 2024 amounted to DKK -83m and were mainly costs related to capital structure considerations, strategic initiatives deriving from the global expansion and legal costs related to the sea freight dispute. Profit for the year amounted to DKK 6m compared to
DKK 24m in 2023. The profit margin of 0.1% is slightly lower than 0.5-1% in the Outlook for 2024. This predominantly relates to loss from discontinuing operations. The profit margin from continuing operations of 0.5% is within expectations.

Free Cash Flow and Net Interest-bearing Debt
Net Working Capital (NWC) decreased in absolute terms from DKK -57m in 2023 to DKK -322m in 2024. The
decrease was mainly the result of a decline in receivables following the settlement with our former freight forwarder. The impact from higher inventory due to earlier order timing was offset by higher trade payables, as supplier payment terms were improved in 2024.
Cash flow from investing activities was DKK -190m in 2024 against DKK -144m in 2023. The increase in investments mainly came from capex related to new store openings.
Free cash flow in 2024 amounted to DKK 694m compared to DKK 811m in 2023. Free cash flow was mainly impacted by higher interest expenses.
Net interest-bearing debt was DKK 3,693m at the end of 2024 compared to DKK 3,751m in 2023. This includes a decrease in lease liabilities and a net increase in bank debt. Net interest-bearing debt, excluding lease liabilities was DKK 1,756m at the end of 2024 compared to DKK 1,728m in 2023.




Provisions for the Acquisition of Non- controlling Interest and Equity
Shareholders with a non-controlling interest hold a put option to sell their non-controlling interest to Zebra, whereas Zebra A/S holds a call option to acquire
the partners' non-controlling interest. Under IFRS Accounting Standards, Zebra is considered as controlling these partnerships, which results in full consolidation.
Accordingly, the subsidiaries are fully consolidated in the financial statements and provisions have been made for the acquisition of the non-controlling interests. The provision is measured as the estimated total amount owed to the partners upon the partners exercising their put options. Under the accounting policies of the Group, changes in the fair value of these liabilities, including differences upon settlement, are accounted for as a transaction directly in equity.
Exercise prices are determined with reference to contractually defined EBITDA multiples. The calculation of the provisions under IFRS for the put options is based on the general assumption that all the partners exercise their put options at year-end 2024 with the agreed notice period of 12 months.
The increase in provisions for the acquisition of non- controlling interests (non-current and current in total), from DKK 253m in 2023 to DKK 270m in 2024, was driven by the fair value adjustment from the estimated present value of the expected cash outflows to settle the put options. The increase is the result of a stronger performance in 2024. By the end of 2024, the Group had acquired partnerships for DKK 933m in all.
Zebra's call options covering the remaining ownership interests in certain subsidiaries are recognised in the balance sheet as a derivative financial instrument. The fair value of the call options is determined by the estimated fair value of the non-controlling interests less the exercise price determined with reference to the contractually defined EBITDA multiples. Changes in the fair value of these financial derivatives are included in the statement of profit or loss. In 2024, the fair value of the call options was DKK 662m and the fair value adjustment included in the statement of profit or loss was DKK 183m.
The joint venture in Japan is an exception to this model and is therefore not consolidated. Unlike our 50/50 partnerships in Europe, we share joint control with our partner in Japan. As a result, the profits or losses from the joint venture are recognised as a single line item in the income statement, and the investment is measured using the equity method.

We continue to focus on strengthening current operations and ensuring that
our e-commerce business develops positively across our core markets in Europe.




Equity
Zebra's equity amounted to DKK -1,379m at the end of 2024. It was positively impacted by the net profit for the year as well as other comprehensive income and offset by fair value adjustments of provisions for the acquisition of non-controlling interests and the dividend paid to non- controlling interests.

Negative Reported Equity/ Financial Position of the Group and the Parent Company
In 2024, the equity of the Group ended the year at a negative amount of DKK 1,379m and with a negative amount of DKK 760m for the Parent Company. A substantial part of the negative equity stems from COVID-19 in 2020.
In June 2024, the Group's bank facilities were renegotiated to support the medium-term business plan. This was aided by the shareholders at that time providing shareholder loans in an amount of DKK 100m. The amendments included an extension of the bank facilities as well as an amortisation plan over two years beginning at the end of 2025 with DKK 100m and DKK 2,325m in 2026.
Per 31 December 2024, Zebra A/S breached a leverage ratio covenant. Consequently, the book value of the relevant loans of DKK 2,116m has been classified as current liabilities as at 31 December 2024.
As described under subsequent events, Executive Management has at the beginning of June 2025 obtained control of Zebra A/S. Further, Zebra A/S has amended
its bank facilities with its lenders which will include a reduction of the interest-bearing debt of the Company to DKK 1,185m at the mid of June 2025 with no current
instalments due before maturity of the debt in June 2028.

Executive Management and the Board of Directors are comfortable with the progress of the business and the liquidity, and they have carefully assessed the current financial situation for the Parent Company and the Group, including the in 2024 initiated activities and ongoing initiatives for the Group in 2025, the forecasted trading, results and cash flows, current interest rates, uncertainties and available funding.
We continue to focus on strengthening current operations and ensuring that our e-commerce business develops positively across our core markets in Europe. Furthermore, our franchise business continues to expand according to plan, with a number of new partners added. 2025 will see the addition of new markets and many new stores among both existing and new franchise partners. This together with the capital contribution described under subsequent
events, provides the Executive Management and the Board





of Directors with the confidence to forecast profitable growth in the future that will contribute to restoring the share capital and reported equity over the coming years.
Our positive outlook for 2025 and beyond is based on the increased customer footfall, which we are already seeing, as well as improvements in product supply that will drive strong trading. Furthermore, we assume an improvement in working capital and reduced financing costs.
As the available funding (liquidity position and available financing, including available commitments) is assessed to be adequate, the Executive Management deems there to be sufficient basis for continuing the operations and initiatives for developing the Group further. Please also refer to note 1.3 Going concern.

Parent Company
In 2024, the Parent Company realised revenue of DKK 2,479m compared to DKK 2,267m in 2023. The growth of 9.4% was higher than expected and mainly
due to higher sales to our subsidiaries and franchisees. EBITDA before special items in 2024 was DKK 11m compared to DKK 105m in 2023 and lower than expected due to a decrease in gross profit. The loss for the year amounted to DKK 205m due to impairment losses related to financial assets.

Subsequent Events
Following the end of the 2024 financial year, significant events have taken place that will influence Zebra A/S's future strategic direction and financial structure:
In February 2025, a new Board of Directors was appointed, marking a key transition in corporate governance. As part of this change, Treville appointed board members stepped down from the Board. In the beginning of June 2025, the Executive Management, with the support of the banks, completed a management buy-out ("MBO"), ultimately obtaining a majority ownership of the Company.
As part of the MBO, the Executive Management and the banks have agreed to redesign Zebra A/S's capital structure through an equity contribution amounting to DKK 1,390m of which DKK 1,240m will be used to settle a portion of the former debt while DKK 150m will be contributed to strengthen the overall liquidity of Zebra A/S. The contributions will take place by mid of June 2025. Further, loans from prior shareholders of
DKK 225m have been forgiven in connection with the change of ownership thus further reducing Zebra A/S's debt and improving equity.





The above contributions exceed the reported negative equity of the Group at 31 December 2024 of DKK 1,379m.
The remaining interest-bearing debt after completing the contributions mid of June 2025 amounts to DKK 1,185m. The maturities of the remaining interest-bearing debt have been agreed to be extended and will expire in June 2028, with a more favourable interest profile and no instalments due before June 2028.
The new capital structure will result in a positive equity of the parent company Zebra A/S and the Group's equity is also expected to be positive at the end
of 2025. It provides Zebra with a solid and resilient financial platform, enabling future growth initiatives and reinforcing management's commitment to the long-term success of the business.

Outlook 2025
As a new capital structure and ownership model was agreed in Q2 2025, the Group's financial foundation will be substantially strengthened. With reduced debt levels and more favourable financing terms, the Group will going forward have significantly enhanced financial
stability. This stronger position supports a positive outlook and provides a solid platform for delivering long-term growth and operational efficiency in the years ahead.
Assuming a stable external environment, the Group's revenue is expected to increase by 5-7% in 2025 compared to 2024. This anticipated growth reflects ongoing momentum in retail performance, with continued investment in capabilities that strengthen the Group's long-term competitive position. This path is aimed at building a resilient, agile organisation with a
scalable platform. EBITDA margin before special items is expected to be in the range 19-23%.
The Parent Company's revenue is expected to increase by 2-5% in 2025 compared to 2024. EBITDA margin before special items is expected to be in the range 3-6%. We expect the profit margin for the Group in 2025 to be in the range 0.5-1%.
Overall, the 2025 outlook underscores the Group's commitment to balanced growth, margin discipline and strategic investment, setting a strong foundation for sustained value creation in the coming years.

    Risk Management




Financial Risk
The nature of Zebra A/S's (Zebra) operations, investments and financing arrangements expose the Group to financial risks from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rate levels. The Group's treasury policy is to actively address financial risks to mitigate material impacts on the Group's financial position.
In 2025, Zebra A/S has agreed to an improved capital structure, mitigating financial risk across several key areas. The company secured DKK 1.4 billion in new capital, which will significantly reduce its financial exposure. This will enable the repayment of historical debt, and together with the renegotiation of financing terms, result in a more robust financial foundation, a lower interest burden, and increased operational flexibility.
For more information, see note 4.4 Financial Risk Management to the consolidated financial statements.

Currency Risk
Zebra's international activities imply that the Group's financial results, cash flows and equity are exposed to fluctuations in various foreign currencies.
The main exchange rate exposure that Zebra faces relates to the purchase of goods in foreign currency, mainly USD, and net cash flows from foreign subsidiaries. It is the Group's policy to hedge approximately 90%, 80%, 70% and 60% of the currency risk associated with procurement (excluding franchise procurement) for the subsequent
1-3 months, 4-6 months, 7-9 months, and 10-12 months, respectively.
Exchange rate exposures related to translation of the financial results and the equity of foreign subsidiaries into DKK are not hedged.
Interest Rate Risk
Zebra is exposed to interest rate risk because entities of the Group borrow funds at variable interest rates. Zebra monitors the risk, and hedging is applied when needed in accordance with the Group's treasury policy.
Liquidity Risk
Zebra monitors liquidity flow to ensure adequate liquidity resources are available to the Group.
Funding Risk
Zebra has credit facilities with covenants, which are customary for such facilities.
Should Zebra fail to comply with the covenants, the lenders may terminate the credit facilities post an applicable remedy period. All covenants are monitored and reported on a regular basis, enabling Zebra to act proactively if required.





Credit Risk
The Group has limited credit risk exposure related to trade receivables, as revenue transactions are mainly settled by cash, credit or debit cards, and the Group is not exposed to any major credit risk related to trade receivables
from any single customer or other party. The Group has implemented a franchise setup which in time will expose the Group to higher credit risk. The Group is exposed to counterparty risk from cash held at financial institutions and unrealised gains on financial contracts.
In addition, the Group is indirectly exposed to credit risk arising from credit insurance companies providing
insurance coverage to the Group's suppliers. A generally reduced risk appetite from the credit insurance companies could have a negative impact on the payment terms offered by the Group's suppliers. Consequently, this may impact the net working capital. Zebra regularly engages with the credit insurance companies and suppliers to ensure they are updated on relevant topics.
Tax
As part of Zebra conducting business across 28 countries, the Group is exposed to potential tax and transfer pricing disputes with local tax authorities. Zebra is committed to ensuring compliance with local tax laws and international transfer pricing regulation in the markets that the Group operates in.
Pillar Two legislation has been enacted or substantively enacted in certain jurisdictions in which the Group operates. However, this legislation does not apply to the Group, as its consolidated revenue is lower than EUR 750m.

Operational Risk
Zebra has identified key operational risks within the following areas:

Marketplace Sourcing
Products, Trademarks, and Legal Claims Partner Collaboration and Buyout People
Cybersecurity

Annual Report 2024

Management Commentary	31




Marketplace
Competition
As a global retailer, Zebra is exposed to competition from other retailers with a value proposition like Zebra's as well as competition from online formats. To compete with other retailers, Zebra continues to invest in and develop the Flying Tiger Copenhagen brand and concept to maintain the concept's edge and attractive value proposition through brick-and-mortar-shops and online. Initiatives include the ongoing development of the concept as
well as strengthening the Group's creative capabilities within category management, sustainability, design and innovation, visual merchandising, marketing, branding and the training of store staff to continuously improve the service provided in the stores.
Customer Preferences
Zebra's assortment must meet customer preferences for our concept if we are to remain successful. Should we fail to develop and offer the right products at the right prices, financial performance will be affected. We therefore continuously review our assortment and actively engage in category management to constantly improve our sustainability performance, product attractiveness and to keep abreast of market trends.
Operations
Zebra's strategy requires strong performance throughout the business and value chain. Failure to adequately address performance issues in a timely manner in local markets may impact the Group's financial results. Hence, Zebra is continually improving its monitoring, business reviewing and controlling to proactively address any potential disruptions in local markets.

Sourcing
Forecasting
At Zebra, we are continually strengthening our forecasting approach and ability to better forecast product demand.
Failure to correctly assess demand will impact financial results negatively. Underestimating demand can lead to availability issues and missed sales with limited opportunities for substitution. Likewise, overestimating demand can lead to inventory build-up and potential
future stock mark-downs and write-downs that impact the financial results negatively. This is therefore monitored closely. In 2023, we rolled out a replenishment tool to further strengthen the forecasting process.





Suppliers
Production is outsourced to external suppliers. If suppliers fail to comply with Zebra's Supplier Code of Conduct,
the Group's reputation and brand may be jeopardised. Therefore, suppliers must adhere to the Code of Conduct with compliance monitored through a supplier audit programme. Please refer to the Sustainability and People section for further information about Zebra's ambitious sustainability efforts and the results we have achieved.
Supply Chain Disruptions
Disruption to our supply chain, both inbound to our warehouses and outbound from our warehouses to stores, may cause product shortages and/or longer lead times.
This could negatively impact our reputation, ability to meet demand and our financial results. To mitigate such potentially negative impacts, Zebra continuously oversees the supply chain. We also invest in and build sourcing and supply chain systems, processes and capabilities on an ongoing basis.
Furthermore, Zebra holds a marine cargo insurance policy.

The attacks on merchant ships in the Red Sea and the subsequent re-routing by carriers to go around the Cape of Good Hope have resulted in only minor delays to delivering products on time to our stores around the world.
The Group continues to monitor developments to address any potential further disruptions.

Products, Trademarks, and Legal Claims
Zebra operates in several legal jurisdictions and introduces an array of products each month. Failure to comply with local regulations may negatively affect both our reputation and our financial performance. Violations of our trademarks or product designs and damage caused by the use and/or misuse of our products may cause similar effects.
To mitigate this, Zebra has policies and process controls guiding our day-to-day operations across the business. Further, Zebra has dedicated teams focused on legal and compliance matters that pertain to our business model. When required, we use external advisors.

Partner Collaboration and Buyout
Zebra's success abroad was originally built on a 50/50 partnership model sharing investments, costs and profits with our partners. Zebra owns and develops the concept as well as the brand and we supply the products, while our partners carry out the store rollouts and local day-to-day operations.





Business plans, frameworks and guidelines are jointly developed and outlined in our partnership agreement, and these mechanisms and incentives ensure the alignment of interests. Failure to maintain successful collaboration may adversely affect our financial results.
When entering new markets nowadays, we build our expansion on a franchise model instead of the 50/50 partnerships that were initially used to roll out stores across markets. Due to strategic considerations and the present business model for expansion, the number of our 50/50 partnerships has decreased significantly in recent years.
Part of our strategy is to take full ownership of local operating companies when that is assessed to be beneficial.
To ensure the strong financial performance continues during and after a transformation period, the partner model entails a put option or a call option of one year, allowing Zebra and the partner to develop a transition plan to ensure timely identification of new management and to deploy various measures that ensure retention of key local employees and general business continuity.

People
Zebra is dependent on our ability to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified employees at all levels of our organisation. From store staff and managers to creatives and administrative teams at HQ.




Cybersecurity
Zebra works continuously and proactively to mitigate cybersecurity risks. Throughout 2024, we have implemented several initiatives to address specific focus areas, enhancing both systems and processes. Our strategic mitigation efforts will continue into 2025.

Special Risks
The sourcing and delivery of products, primarily from China, have been stable throughout 2024. The tragic situation in Gaza and the related negative impact on the vital shipping route through the Red Sea have caused minor delays for us as carriers navigate around Africa. We continuously monitor any potential geopolitical tensions and remain focused on potential risks of this nature.
Russia's devastating invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has had an enormous impact on the global economy and stability. However, as we have no activities in either country, neither store presence nor any sourcing or supplier base, we have no direct risks.
Inflation increased dramatically around the world in 2022 and 2023 and continues to be relevant, affecting prices in all consumer goods categories and energy sources. The price increases on raw materials have affected our product offering slightly, but as we manage the design process and material choices, we have navigated through the upsurge in inflation in a very controlled manner.

2024 AT A GLANCE
A Flying Start in Türkiye





The Turkish market had long been on our target list of franchise markets for expansion. As one of the 20 largest economies in the world, with a population of over 85 million - characterised by a young demographic and a proud trading tradition - it presents a highly attractive opportunity for our growth beyond Europe.
After a thorough selection process, we chose Karaca Group as our partner in Türkiye. With a strong heritage, an established presence in the Turkish market, and a solid foundation as a family-owned company, Karaca was the perfect fit.
Before finalising our market entry, our Shanghai and Copenhagen teams worked closely with Karaca to assess and address complex supply chain challenges, including compliance, packaging and customs clearance.
With these critical aspects confirmed in February 2024, we were ready to move forward with planning the finer details of our expansion into Türkiye.

Approach & Actions
The preparations for the Turkish market launch began back in March 2024, when a contract-signing event was hosted in Istanbul to officially announce the market entry into Türkiye and attract attention from customers and landlords.
The grand market opening in Türkiye took place during the first week of October 2024 with an extensive
programme. The first two stores, located in A-grade malls - Kanyon Mall and Galataport Mall - were the cornerstones of the events. Prior to the official public launch, multiple press meetings, a workshop and extensive branding at the malls set the scene.

A massive welcome party took place on 2 October at Kanyon with 600 guests in attendance. Dancers, mime artists and a band warmed up the audience before "the market launch button" was pressed, officially opening the store in a blizzard of confetti! A VIP shopping event took place on the evening of 2 October with 300 customers prior to the official opening on 3 October 2024.
The reception from customers was amazing. Despite setting high expectations, these were exceeded by a significant margin. The first store in Kanyon Mall beat the record for most sales in one day in the IMEA region by over 20% during the opening weekend. Customer demand seemed unending in the first few weeks, with a constant line outside the first two stores and thousands of daily transactions.
Performance was exceptional: the first store ranked #1 globally in October and continued ranking #3 in Q4. Throughout Q4, the long lines of shoppers continued at each store opening. A total of 11 stores were opened in Türkiye in Q4 2024.
The expansion journey in the Turkish market will continue into 2025 as we enter new cities and aim to open 25 stores - bringing the Flying Tiger Copenhagen brand to even more Turkish customers. Our long-term target is 100+ stores across the country.


"Türkiye has long been a strategic priority for us, and with Karaca Group, we've found the ideal partner. We're truly overwhelmed by the warm welcome from Turkish customers - it's been beyond our expectations.
Jens Aarup Mikkelsen CEO International

Annual Report 2024






At Flying Tiger Copenhagen, we are always on a mission to bring joy, surprise and that little spark of delight to our customers. In 2024, we embarked on an exciting journey to connect even better with our customers by launching the Flying Tiger Copenhagen Customer Club - a digital- first initiative aimed at giving more value to our customers while learning more about what drives them, ultimately contributing to our long-term growth ambitions.

In a retail landscape where customer expectations are higher than ever, staying close to those who love our quirky and creative products is crucial. The challenge was clear: build a platform that strengthens customer relationships while driving more frequent store visits and larger baskets.

Prior to the 2024 rollout, we had already achieved success with membership programmes in Spain and Italy. Spain, in particular, served as a valuable test market, guiding our thinking for what would become the Flying Tiger Copenhagen Customer Club. The insights from Spain shaped a programme built on fun, simplicity and meaningful early benefits while aligning with our broader customer experience strategy. They also informed the technology and operational framework to ensure the programme is scalable.

Approach & Actions
We hit the ground running in June 2024 with the launch of the Flying Tiger Copenhagen Customer Club in Denmark. Soon after, we brought the club to Sweden, Norway, Finland, Germany and the UK, setting the stage for an even bigger international rollout in 2025. The Customer Club is not just any membership programme; it is a club where members get real, tangible benefits that make them smile. Through our dedicated app that includes a digital membership card scanned in stores, members enjoy vouchers, exclusive promotions (think multi-buy offers and club-only prices) and even early access to our Black Friday deals - because who doesn't love a good head start on holiday shopping?

While rewards were the perfect starting point (because customers care about them most), they are not the endgame. The Customer Club is about much more than just discounts. It is a way to connect directly with
customers, understand their preferences and behaviours, and create richer, more personalised shopping experiences that will evolve over time. Our approach combines simplicity with excitement, making the Club easy to join and hard to resist. At every step, we kept the Flying Tiger Copenhagen spirit alive: engaging, bold and always with a twist of fun.

Management Commentary	35







The response? By the end of 2024, the Flying Tiger Copenhagen Customer Club counted over 300,000 members who are not just signing up and staying - only 0.5% of members dropped out - but actively engaging. Club members visit our stores more often and leave with fuller baskets compared to non-members (+60% basket value, +70% basket quantity) - accounting for 7% of
our revenue in the respective markets and proving that everyone loves a good deal and a great experience. The app has become a hub of activity, with customers eagerly redeeming vouchers, taking advantage of member-only promotions and enjoying their early-access perks. Beyond the numbers, this is about building stronger relationships and creating moments of joy for every customer who walks through our doors (or taps into our app).


"We are rolling out several initiatives to enhance the customer experience, whether they engage with us
in-store or in the digital universe. To achieve this, we are improving our customer journey across all platforms, with the new app serving as a valuable addition to our channels and a cornerstone of our omnichannel strategy.

With our customer club and app, we aim to strengthen our connection with customers, particularly during their in-store visits. It is a win-win: we gain valuable insights into consumer behaviour, while our customers enjoy exclusive membership benefits"
Andre Filomeno, Senior Vice President of "Customer &
Digital" at Flying Tiger Copenhagen.


This is just the beginning. As we look to 2025, the Flying Tiger Copenhagen Customer Club will continue to grow, both in scale and functionality. We will keep adding new ways to engage, surprise and delight our customers through enhanced app features and more
meaningful ways to reward engagement while deepening our understanding of what they need and love. From brick-and-mortar to e-commerce and beyond, the Customer Club is at the heart of our vision for a seamless, omnichannel customer experience.

2024 AT A GLANCE
New Collaboration within the
Toys Category





As part of our ongoing efforts to enhance our product offering, we partnered with Plus-Plus to create a unique selection of products available to customers across 25 markets. This was achieved by combining our in-house designs with a selection of Plus-Plus formats.
At Flying Tiger Copenhagen, we recognised an opportunity to enhance our construction product offering within the Toys category. Collaborating with
Plus-Plus allowed us to work with an expert in this product area who shares our common goals. Together, the two brands aim to inspire people of all ages to explore the endless possibilities of construction and design through interlocking, jigsaw-like pieces in a wide variety of colours. The collaboration combines the brands' shared values of creating engaging and imaginative products.

Approach & Actions
Plus-Plus and Flying Tiger Copenhagen have collaborated closely to develop the product collections. By utilising our collective experience, we have developed a compelling product assortment across a mix of price points and formats.
The initial products were launched in two specially designed collections:
A Christmas campaign, featuring items such as Christmas hearts and candy canes.
An "Above the Sky Universe" collection, where flying unicorns and dragons come to life, offering playtime for both young children practising fine motor skills and more experienced creators.
In addition to product development, we ensured that effective point-of-sale materials were created to support the product offering within the store environment. There was a clear focus on highlighting the collaboration, and we encouraged stores to provide space for customers to test the products.





For 2025, we are continuing to develop new options for relevant commercial themes to maximise the potential in this area.
Our year-to-date like-for-like sales within the Construction category have grown by 18%. Since its launch in the first week of October, 18% of annual sales in this category have been generated from the Plus-Plus product assortment.
Initial feedback has been positive, and we have gained valuable insights into customer behaviour within this product category.
We continue to collaborate closely with Plus-Plus to ensure we are developing a relevant and engaging assortment for future campaigns. As we gain further insights into customer behaviour, we will leverage this information to support future product development. We are excited to maximise the potential of this collaboration and explore other opportunities in the future.


"I am very excited about this new collaboration where we are able to bring a completely new creative concept to our customers. The Plus-Plus universe of educational and creative toys has great synergy with our customer base, and the new range of products is a perfect match with our ambition to enable more creative, educational and playful experiences for kids, adults and families"
Darryl Nash, Senior Vice President of "Commercial Product
& Design" at Flying Tiger Copenhagen.

Zebra A/S
Annual Report 2024






In accordance with section 99(d) of the Danish Financial Statements Act, the following sections set out Zebra A/S' approach to data ethics.
Approved by our Board of Directors in February 2024, the purpose of our Data Ethics Policy is to both externally and internally communicate our position on data ethics and to encourage all employees to handle all data with respect and integrity.
In a world where the pace of technological progress continues to accelerate and data increasingly shapes individuals' lives, the opportunities stemming from digitalisation and the use of artificial intelligence have never been greater - both with regard to improving our customers' experiences online and in-store and also in maturing internal business processes.
However, such opportunities also come with certain risks, both to people and society, which is why proper data and risk management must go beyond compliance and doing what is written to broadening the focus towards also doing what is right. Therefore, view the following
as an overarching layer to our existing compliance efforts in relation to data, including data protection compliance. Hence, our Data Ethics Policy applies to all
data processing, regardless of whether it is categorised as personal or non-personal data.
With our 'Flying Tiger Copenhagen Data Ethics Compass', we wish to set a baseline for which principles and considerations to apply when data-related discussions are initiated and decisions are made.

Policy Scope
This Data Ethics Policy applies to Zebra A/S, our employees, Board of Directors and subsidiaries.
Employees should base their decisions and actions relating to data on the Flying Tiger Copenhagen Data Ethics Compass as set out in this Data Ethics Policy.

Our Data Processing
In Zebra A/S, we process data of both a personal and non- personal nature as part of our daily operations in sales, supply chain, marketing, HR, finance and technology.
Our main group of individuals whose data is processed are our customers and our employees. Primarily, we process data as a controller, e.g. when processing our customers' data to fulfil a purchase or to obtain a better understanding of our customers' views on our products and services. In relation to our employees, we process data as part of our day-to-day HR operations.

Management Commentary	39







We process a variety of data ranging from non-personal and ordinary personal data, e.g. financial figures, product information, purchase and general contact data to sensitive personal data such as employee health data.
To better target our online marketing activities and content to our customers, we use customer data to create segments. Different parameters, such as newsletter engagement, campaign responses and website behaviour data are used to improve our general marketing and targeting activities, and to design better user experiences for our customers.
Also, we utilise generative AI technology to support us with some content generation, basic translations and customer service training. However, no input or output is used or generated without human oversight
and involvement, and all use of generative AI is done in accordance with our Generative AI Guidelines.

Our Data Ethics Work
Ultimately, our Board of Directors is responsible for our business operations and thereby also our data ethics practices. To ensure the Data Ethics Compass is
developed and applied throughout the organisation, the responsibility for developing and growing our data ethics efforts is anchored with our AI & Data Ethics Sounding Board ("Sounding Board"). The Sounding Board consists of representatives with relevant skills and mandates from functions such as Technology, Customer & Digital and Legal.
The Sounding Board's purpose, tasks and decision-making process are further outlined in terms of reference. These terms also outline when and how top management should be involved in the decision-making process for certain data-use cases. The Sounding Board meets regularly
to discuss specific use cases and matters concerning governance, processes and awareness. Throughout 2025, the Sounding Board will continue to discuss and develop initiatives in these areas.

Our Data Ethics Compass
When decisions are made pertaining to data in Flying Tiger Copenhagen, decision-makers should navigate based on three main principles to ensure data ethical considerations are thought into data-use cases and decisions.














The Three Principles

 Transparency and Respect
We understand and recognise that our customers are increasingly making active choices and that these are motivated by their trust, or lack of such, in businesses and their general practices. For us, customer is, and will always be, king.
Our company is based on an open culture where cultivation of trust is key. Just as we want to foster trust in our product practices, we want to do the same when it comes to our data practices.
We aim to be open, honest and respectful about our data collecting and use to ensure the individuals trusting us with their data always meet open doors, whether they are being informed or inquiring about our data practices. The individuals we process data on must be able to trust that we communicate our practices clearly and in due time and that we continuously calibrate our processes to ensure such transparency.




Transparency and Respect

Equality
and Diversity

Equality and Diversity
Embracing diversity and inclusion is key. We want our people to be their fearless selves. At Flying Tiger Copenhagen, we continue to ensure and embrace these principles in our hiring and people management practices.
We do not tolerate any type of discrimination or injustice in our business practices. This also applies to our data practices, where we continuously work to ensure that our data processing is free from discrimination, bias and consequences that could negatively impact individuals. Therefore, we want to ensure that our decision-making process warrants a diverse group of decision-makers properly reflecting any given matter.



Responsibility and Accountability

  Responsibility and Accountability
We put our hearts into everything we do because if we do not, it does not matter. This applies throughout our operations and to our data practices as well. We strive to care for the data entrusted to us in a responsible manner throughout the data lifecycle: from collection to destruction.
We recognise we are responsible for all partners and suppliers working with the data entrusted to us on our behalf, and that we remain accountable throughout the data lifecycle. We will not disclose data to third parties beyond what is needed to achieve our strategic goals, and we will not sell any data to third parties.



Zebra A/S

As a responsible company, we are tasked with protecting our brand integrity and maintaining customer trust.
We remain dedicated to delivering high-quality products that are safe, legal and compliant with all applicable standards and regulations.

How We Work with Product Compliance
During the product development stage, the primary objective is to ensure that the product meets all specified requirements.
The process begins with the evaluation and discussion of design proposals. We evaluate product designs based on legal regulations and standards to ensure the product meets all relevant safety requirements. This is followed by a product analysis phase, where we review specific product samples. During this phase, potential safety
issues may be identified, prompting recommendations for adjustments and improvements to enhance the product's design and safety.
All products must have an approved Bill of Material (BOM) before proceeding to the next phase, where the necessary testing requirements for the product are outlined and the product is approved for production.
In 2024, we assessed and confirmed 6000+ Bills of Materials for new products.

Documentation
The finished product is subject to several tests to ensure its compliance with the relevant legal requirements and standards. These tests are performed by accredited third-party laboratories.
Once we have received and approved all necessary product documentation, a Declaration of Conformity (DoC) is issued for relevant products. This confirms that the product conforms to the relevant regulations and standards, allowing the product to be distributed for sale.
In 2024, 6000+ tests were performed by third-party laboratories.

Ongoing Market Monitoring
We also monitor the performance of our products while they are on the market. This involves collecting and analysing consumer claims and complaints, staying updated on the latest requirements, standards and regulations, and sharing this information with relevant business partners to maintain quality and compliance.

Management Commentary	43






Information on Packaging
Packaging not only protects the product but also serves as a platform for legally required product information - in multiple languages - and the requirements for information are increasing. Using less material means less space to display this essential information.
We continuously strive to minimise the amount of material used in our product packaging and are proud of our progress from a sustainability perspective.
Balancing these priorities remains an ongoing challenge. We are committed to developing solutions that minimise packaging materials while maintaining full compliance with regulatory requirements and providing essential product information for our customers.

Progress in 2024
In 2024, sustainability remained a central focus as we continuously prepare to meet the new requirements outlined in the European Green Deal - some of which have already taken effect, while others are in the pipeline. We anticipate that these initiatives will continue to keep us busy in the years to come.

New Regulations:
Adapting to the Future
Staying informed about regulatory developments is vital as we navigate the evolving landscape of product and packaging compliance. Our diverse product categories require us to manage increasing regulatory complexity by continuously enhancing our knowledge and adapting to new requirements and standards.
The EU's forthcoming regulations will significantly transform our approach to compliance. Key regulations such as the Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation (PPWR), the European Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) and the Eco Design for Sustainable Products Regulation (ESPR) introduce stricter data and reporting obligations across the entire supply chain.
We continuously monitor developments to better foresee our future needs and to be able to adapt to the new requirements.

Sustainability	Our Commitment


At Flying Tiger Copenhagen, we have committed to conducting our business ethically and responsibly. This commitment runs through our entire value chain, from sourcing and shipping to our stores to the end-life of our products.
It is vital to our customers that our products are produced according to ethical, environmental and social standards and are safe to use. Vital to our customers - and vital to our company's success.
Our business model requires a high level of control throughout our value chain - from product design, packaging design, material use and testing to the logistics setup and the running of our stores. Our green transition is clearly complex but most certainly doable.
The Executive Management is responsible for overall sustainability performance. We have a team specifically dedicated to managing GHG emission reductions that reports to executive leadership on a monthly basis to discuss sustainability risks and opportunities. Our company strategy addresses both commercial and sustainability ambitions.
Common key performance indicators (KPIs) are used, and constantly refined, for monthly status reporting and performance management.
Flying Tiger Copenhagen's ambition is to become a global beacon in sustainable retail, knowing that we are doing our part to pass on a better planet for future generations. This means offering affordable products with the lightest possible carbon footprint and actively working to become independent of virgin fossil-based materials and fuels.
2024 was a year when we made some solid progress on sustainability but also saw a degree of slowdown on certain targets. Demonstrating our commitment to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), we kept
working on ways to minimise our CO2 footprint, with good results. We are proud to once again receive an EcoVadis silver medal for our dedication to the environment, human rights, labour rights, ethics and sustainable procurement. Our third silver medal running! This sustainability performance score places us among the top 6% of companies globally.
Working diligently with our sustainability targets, we have achieved great success and have even exceeded our expectations on several occasions.




In accordance with sections 99(a) of the Danish Financial Statements Act, we have included this section to report on our approach to corporate responsibility. As a signatory of the United Nations' Global Compact (UNGC), we commit to its corporate sustainability Business Principles encompassing human rights, employment standards, environment and anti-corruption. This is our annual Communication on Progress report.

Sustainability in our Value Chain









Upstream value chain


Raw materials
We want to offer our customers fun, surprising, and creative choices that also reduce environmental impact. To achieve this, we make responsible material selection a key part of product design. We focus
on circular materials, efficient design, packaging reduction, and clear labeling.

Suppliers
We are committed to responsible sourcing, strong supplier relationships, and ethical production. Our suppliers and factories undergo screening and audits to meet social and environmental standards. All our products undergo the required testing to ensure quality, durability, and compliance with regulations.





Own operations




Logistics
Most of our products are shipped via sea freight, with the remainder transported by road. We work with logistics partners to reduce emissions and continuously improve transportation efficiency. Minimising packaging waste, particularly plastic, is a priority in shipping and distribution.



Stores and offices
Our stores and offices are designed to reduce our environmental impact while creating a unique and engaging customer experience. We encourage responsible practices in daily operations, ensuring that materials, energy, and resources are used efficiently. Our store layouts incorporate design principles that prioritise long-term usability.

Warehousing
Our warehousing operations focus on efficiency by continuously optimising logistics, packaging, and storage methods.




Downstream value chain


E-Commerce
Our e-commerce operations are designed to be agile and adaptable. We continuously test and implement new solutions to enhance sustainability in online sales, from plastic free packaging, reducing packaging waste to optimising delivery routes.

Customer use and consumption
We market our products responsibly, ensuring they meet high safety and compliance standards. In our own operations, including offices, warehouses, and stores, we focus on reducing CO2 emissions and incorporating circularity into our materials and processes.

Waste and end of life of products
We take responsibility for the entire lifecycle of our products by designing with longevity and
recyclability in mind. Our choices prioritise materials and recyclable options that reduce environmental impact. We continuously improve product design, reinforcing our commitment to minimising waste and supporting a circular economy.

Double Materiality Assessment
In 2024, we began our preparations for the CSRD (Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive), which was supposed to come into effect from financial year 2025. Following the Omnibus, we are now in scope to report from financial year 2027 instead. We will, however, continue to use the CSRD framework to drive impact and align our reporting in the years to come.
We conducted our first double materiality assessment in 2023. The assessment covers upstream and downstream value chain activities and our own operations. Our material impacts, risks and opportunities are assessed across environment, social and governance topics, with each topic assessed according to financial materiality and impact on the planet and society. On a scale of 1-5, the scoring criteria consider both potential and actual impacts across magnitude of risk (financial, operational, legal and reputational), severity (scale, scope and irremediability) and likelihood of impact. The double materiality assessment is a living document within Flying Tiger Copenhagen that we are continuously developing and diving deeper into as knowledge and experience build around different ESG topics.
In 2024, we continued working with our double materiality assessment and the upcoming CSRD reporting by strengthening ESG governance across the organisation and assigning functional leaders to each topic who report to senior leadership.

Environmental Disclosures

Climate Action
As global warming will create major disruptions on a global scale, we must act accordingly by decarbonising our value chain and doing whatever is within our means to mitigate the negative and unpredictable consequences of climate change. Doing this is a license for us to operate and for our customers to buy our products. Global legislation is moving to reflect climate change realities, and we expect taxation on greenhouse gas emissions will further encourage a green transition.

Ambitions
Ultimately, our dependency on virgin fossil-based materials and fuels must end. We have developed targets, validated by The Science Based Targets initiative, to reduce our total greenhouse gas emission intensity (Scopes 1, 2 and 3) by approximately 30% by 2026. A very high ambition certainly, but also achievable. In 2021, our GHG targets were approved by the Science Based Targets initiative as aligned with the Paris Agreement's 1.5 degree pathway.
Our ambition is to reduce the emissions from our products and from the transportation of our products as much as possible by using low-emission product materials and by optimising our use of fuel and the flow of our goods. Our goal is to lead this industry in a positive direction by setting high requirements for relevant partners.

Progress in 2024
As a global retailer, our impact on the planet is a major responsibility, and our sustainability initiatives must be reflected throughout our value chain.
Our environmental policy underlines our commitment to protecting the environment and the climate by minimising our negative impact. A substantial share of this impact stems from our products. Our Supplier Code of Conduct therefore further specifies our requirements for environmental awareness and the conduct of our suppliers.
The factors identified as the most significant risks with respect to environmental and climate matters are the use of plastic in our products and our packaging, our logistics setup, the use of fossil fuels in our own
operations and the generation of waste. These are focus areas when we work on lowering our emissions.
In 2024, we evaluated various environmental management systems and certifications but have not yet identified a solution that aligns with our company's needs while enhancing our current practices.

Our Scope 1 emissions are mainly caused by company vehicles. Therefore, our primary focus here is on transitioning to electric vehicles, or hybrid if this is not possible. We have seen significant reductions in Scope 1 emissions, a solid 38% from 2019-2024, which is ahead of our 2026 Science Based Target (SBT) of a 30% reduction.
In Scope 2, we support the transition to renewable electricity in our operations, with an overall target of achieving 84% renewable electricity sourcing by 2026. The numbers show a positive development of 75% so far. When reviewing the operational boundaries of legal entities in preparation for CSRD, we revised our 50/50 partnership entities to be included in our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, as opposed to Scope 3, which accounts for our increase in emissions in both categories relative to last year. Greenhouse gas accounting is an area under constant development, and we always aim to improve data quality and adhere to the latest guidance*. Overall, however, we are still on track to reach our Science Based Targets.
Regarding our purchased goods and services target within Scope 3, most emissions are related to our products and packaging. Here, emissions are compared to gross profit to keep them relative to growth. We see a 30% reduction in our emissions to gross profit compared to 2019, which puts us on track for our 2026 Science Based Target. Naturally, our emissions from products and packaging are very dependent on the use of different types of materials, which is why it is beneficial to consider developments in emissions per kilogram of product and packaging materials. Here we can see a 23% reduction since 2019, which is a clear testament to the positive effect our product material strategy is having on our company's carbon footprint.





Our absolute emissions from products and packaging have increased from last year, as we purchased a greater amount of products in 2024 compared to 2023, in part due to our expansion into additional franchise markets.
However, we are glad to see that the products themselves produce lower emissions. This is why we use measures such as gross profit and emissions per kilogram of materials.
In alignment with our company commitment, we have decided to ask our logistics companies to also commit to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and thereby share our vision on sustainability. We saw a significant increase in the proportion of spend on our logistics suppliers with approved Science Based Targets from 2019 to 2023, but a decrease in 2024 due to changes in major suppliers. We are, however, still on track for our Science Based Target.
A new ECO-delivery agreement commencing January 2024 with our shipping partner, Maersk, means we now use only green fuels* for all our ocean
freight and we have seen significant emission reductions as a result of this. Compared to conventional fossil fuels, seaborne transport emissions are reduced by over 80% on a lifecycle basis.
We also work with our downstream transportation. With e-commerce deliveries, new transport hubs have enabled us to optimise several routes and shorten delivery distances. We have also worked with our franchise partners to collect more comprehensive and higher quality data on transportation
for our greenhouse gas computations, and we have conducted training on sustainability topics.






* The incorporation of 50/50 partnerships into Scopes 1 and 2 has an impact of less than 5% on Flying Tiger Copenhagen's total GHG emissions, making a baseline recalculation (for 2019) unnecessary, according to the SBTi guidance.

*Maersk defines green fuels as fuels with low (65-80% reductions) to very low (80-95% reductions) GHG emissions over their life cycle compared to fossil fuels. Maersk green fuels and its supply chain are verified by the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC). The methodology for accounting emissions is based on GLEC V2 (Global Logistics Emission Council) and is certified by Smart Freight Centre.

At Flying Tiger Copenhagen, emissions are measured in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol	10
Corporate Standard as well as the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Standard.
Normative software is used for the calculations. Our Scope 3 GHG inventory excludes Categories:
8 Upstream Leased Assets, 10 Processing of sold products, 13 Downstream leased assets, and	5
15 Investments. They are excluded because they are not deemed relevant to our business. Category 11, Use of Sold Products, is excluded because the emissions are considerably below 5% of Scope 3 emissions.
We assess the categorisation annually to ensure we follow the GHG Protocol guidelines and any categories that are deemed significant are included. Our 2024 emissions are Scope 1: 280 tCO2e, Scope 2: 6,477 tCO2e, and Scope 3: 151,508 tCO2e for a total of 158,264 tCO2e.
This metric compares the total weight to total emissions of a material.
Further analysis of our product materials emissions shows that when lowering emissions throughout our value chain it is important to target our use of both textiles, primarily polyester and cotton, and plastic - and we are working on it - both in terms of reductions and also using more recycled materials.

Biodiversity and Ecosystems

Healthy Forests
Forests keep our climate stable, regulate our water supply and provide habitats for more than half the world's species. The largest proportion of the materials we use at Flying Tiger Copenhagen originates from or affects forests; hence, ensuring healthy and responsible forestry that provides a stable supply of wood and paper products is very important.

Ambition
Our ambition is that all our wood and paper products derive from sources that practise responsible forestry in terms of considering people, wildlife, environment and biodiversity. All deforestation-risk ingredients like palm oil and cocoa should come from certified deforestation-free sources.

Progress in 2024
Our membership of the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and its certification underlines our support for the promotion of well-managed forests. FSC certification not only entails the protection of biodiversity, it also means respecting the rights of local people and the people working in the forest, which includes workers being properly trained, having decent health and safety conditions and fair wages.
In 2024, in preparation for the EUDR (European Union Deforestation Regulation), we switched to exclusively using FSC 100% and FSC recycled. This was done to avoid FSC Mix, which cannot guarantee deforestation-free content, and also to facilitate the use of recycled content in paper products.
Today, our customers will almost only find FSC-certified wood and paper products in our stores, as well as FSC-certified store furniture and FSC- certified paper cardboard and filling protecting our e-commerce packages.
Our products also contain small amounts of palm oil, primarily in food. Since palm oil is a driver of deforestation, we seek to minimise its use in our products and otherwise use palm oil that is responsibly sourced.

The world is overconsuming resources and producing far too much waste to handle sustainably. Plastic, in particular, is a major issue, and a shift from virgin fossil-oil to renewable or highly recyclable materials is much needed.

Ambitions
Flying Tiger Copenhagen supports the circular economy - the transition towards a circular use of materials whereby all products are designed to eventually become raw materials for new products. Renewable materials will often do this quite naturally, simply by decomposing and becoming nutrients for new growth. For technical materials though, it is a matter of separating and recycling the materials. We also diligently target plastic reduction in both production and packaging.

We use the Eco-conscious definition as an internal tool to ensure our products change in a positive direction.
Seeing the share of these Eco-conscious products steadily increase has been very pleasing. In 2024, 40% of our products matched the Eco-conscious definition. While this represents solid progress, we are still lagging behind our 50% target for 2025. We will continue to work even more closely with our commercial team to achieve our future target.
Single-use products are thrown out after only one use, so the environmental impact is generally high due to the short lifespan. This is why we have set the target to halve our number of single-use products by 2025 from a baseline of 2019, targeting items both with and without plastic. We are well ahead of our target with 49% reduction of single-use items this year.

Progress in 2024
Our most used product materials in 2024 were wood & paper and food, making renewable materials our largest material category by far at a combined sum of 48%. This was followed by fossil fuel-based materials (plastic and paraffin) and the growing product material category ceramics.
Plastic is a versatile material. Lightweight and durable, it can be used for a great many purposes. Unfortunately, it is also very high in emissions and presents an even bigger problem in the end-of-life phase, when there is a high risk of plastic contamination and breakdown into micro plastics. This is why we must be smart about how we use it. Our ambition to further reduce the amount of plastic and to use a lot more recycled plastic in order to support the overall global reduction and recycling of plastics.
From 2019 to 2024, we reduced the use of plastic in our non-food products by 24%. But to reach our 2025 target of a 50% reduction, an even stronger focus on plastic reduction is required. We will also focus on the use of recycled plastic whenever feasible. We will constantly strive to improve, for example by exploring different ways of sourcing recycled materials. Furthermore, we have strict reduction targets on plastic packaging. Read more in our Responsible Packaging section.



Material Sourcing Guideline
When choosing materials for new products we use the guideline below.
The priorities are based on the concept of the circular economy, where products will eventually become new raw materials. We have also considered the CO2 footprint and deforestation issues.



Use renewable/natural materials: e.g. wood, paper, straw, bamboo, cotton, wool
Renewable materials can potentially regenerate or biodegrade to become input for new material cycles.



Use highly recycled/recyclable materials: e.g. glass, metal
Glass and metal are the world's most recycled materials. In theory, they can be recycled indefinitely without losing their qualities.

Use recycled plastics: preferably PET, PP, PE*
By sourcing recycled plastics, we support a crucial development in the recycling industry and lower the CO2e emissions per kilogram of material. Acknowledging that the recycling industry needs to focus on certain plastic types to scale up, we prefer the most commonly used types of plastic.


Use virgin plastics: preferably PET, PP, PE
We want to use as little plastic as possible but it is a difficult material to replace. In order to best support the plastic recycling industry, we prefer the most commonly used types of plastic.



Unwanted plastic types: bio-degradable plastic and bioplastic
Bioplastic is derived from farmed oil (which in most cases could be used as food) and represents the same problems as any other plastic type. Biodegradable plastic types will only

*Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) are the world's most commonly used plastic types and the most widely recycled at the EU level.

Responsible Packaging
Packaging is one of the biggest waste categories around the world. It has a short lifespan and a large environmental impact. Packaging's purpose is not only to protect the product, but also to act as a platform for informing customers about content. Using as little material as possible is the way forward. Not only is this good for the environment, it is also a way to avoid the growth of various taxes on a global scale. Less packaging shows our
customers that we care and helps them minimise their local waste handling.

Ambitions
With packaging, our focus is to:

Use less packaging

Our target is to reduce the plastic used in packaging by 50% from 2019 to

Progress in 2024
Less is more when it comes to great packaging. We continually strive to find the right balance between minimising packaging and using better packaging design and materials. Products need protection and we need to inform our customers about content. Nevertheless, we have made quite substantial reductions in the proportion of plastic packaging we use. Our target was a reduction of 50% by 2025, but in 2024 we are well ahead of our target at 64%.
Making it easy for our customers to recycle packaging is very important for us, and we want to offer 100% recyclable packaging, meaning that it can be easily separated into recyclable categories when discarded. In 2024, 96% of our packaging was recyclable.
Reducing plastic packaging and ensuring 100% recyclability remain our biggest challenges with regard to food products. Plastic offers essential protective qualities, and viable alternatives are limited. This will remain a key focus area.
For non-food products, recyclability has reached 99.5%, with only a few blister packs remaining. In food packaging, the main challenge is replacing metallised plastic, which is highly effective for products with oil content.
Finding sustainable alternatives for this material will also be a priority.

Charity Donations
Donating surplus products to people in need is part of our corporate DNA. We both help disadvantaged families and communities and, at the same time, we minimise our environmental footprint by doing something good with products that would have ended up as unnecessary waste. In 2024, we donated nearly 10% of our unsold products.
Here, we are talking about donations made directly from our global operations, but our local markets make numerous donations and enter various NGO partnerships in addition to this.
In 2024, we donated over 230,000 products to several NGOs in various countries. For instance, we donated a large number of products from our warehouses to the NGO In Kind Direct, who then distributed these to
hundreds of different charities in the UK, including families and children in need.
We partnered with UNHCR to donate 100,000 reading glasses for refugees in Syria. This donation helped address basic human needs and make a difference to the everyday lives of people displaced from their homes.
We also worked with several NGOs to donate unsold food products, thereby minimising food waste across our value chain while making a difference to vulnerable social groups. As an example, we donated food to the Danish Fødevarebanken, who distribute food to various charities. We also donated



Waste
Each year, data quality and sustainability knowledge improves at Flying Tiger Copenhagen. This year we have significantly improved our measurement
of waste, collecting better quality weight of waste fractions from multiple primary sources. This has led to better insights on where we can improve our impact. We have found that nearly 90% of the waste accumulated by our business stems from our stores and headquarters. Unsurprisingly, 61% of
all waste comes from cardboard, wood and paper, mainly from secondary packaging in stores. The next main source of waste is mixed waste, which accounts for 36% of the total waste in our operations. Comparing goods we buy and goods we scrap, about 1% of products were scrapped in 2024 relative to what was purchased.

In our supply chain, we work through our Responsible Procurement Programme, which comprises:

Commitment to the Flying Tiger Copenhagen Supplier Code of Conduct

2 Screening and factory audits
3  Improvement and remediation

All new factories are pre-screened before entering our supply chain through a combination of desk-top and onsite screening audits to ensure they meet acceptable human rights and responsible business standards. Existing factories are selected for audit by assessing the risk based on (a) country of production, (b) purchase volume and (c) product category combined with individual assessments of (a) brand exposure of product and (b) audit history and performance of factory, including sub-contracting practices. These factories are normally audited in a 2-year cycle.
In 2024, we have achieved 100% coverage of factory audits with 687 audits of existing factories and 300 pre-screenings of potential new factories.
We have zero tolerance of child labour and strict rules for young workers (between 16 and 18 years old). In 2024, we found one case of child labour, for which we followed our remediation process. While the existence of child labour is unacceptable, proactively monitoring for child labour in our supply chain means that we can remediate and implement change, one case at a time. The remediation process is conducted in partnership with the Centre for Child Rights and Business. They are experts in these types of cases and make sure that every case is handled according to the individual child's circumstances. The Centre engages in dialogue with the family and ensures appropriate measures, like enrolment in vocational schools and monthly living stipends throughout the remediation period.
We have significantly increased the number of factories audited and pre- screened compared to last year. The most common issue to improve was ensuring a safe and healthy working environment.

Supplier Performance and Training
In 2024, we continued working with our Supplier Performance Management (SPM) programme, which has helped us understand the main points of development that each of our partners should implement and to segment our vendors according to performance levels: Gold, Silver, Bronze and Red, based on results for Quality and Compliance, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Sustainability, Sourcing and Stakeholder Management. We have improved our supplier performance overall, which has resulted in a doubling of the number of Gold suppliers.

We have increased the number of suppliers assessed by the SPM programme and achieved a higher concentration of spend in top performing suppliers.

This metric is measured as the proportion of total Flying Tiger Copenhagen
suppliers in each rating category.

This strong performance can be attributed to a focus on improvements and corrective action plans through Supplier Business Reviews, regular training of suppliers and better relationships with our top suppliers.
We continued to run large, in person, supplier conferences regularly throughout the year, focusing on strategy exchange, learning and development. We have also maintained our already established Supplier Academy, which runs frequent sessions on relevant topics within social requirements, sustainability, compliance, procurement and quality. This allows us to provide training related to the ever-changing retail scene while reaching a broader audience.
In 2024, we held four training sessions with various suppliers in the wood and paper sector to discuss the upcoming EUDR regulation and how this impacts business. We also held two supplier academy sessions on sustainable packaging, which provided training on our updated packaging guidelines.
Additionally, we held nearly 40 Supplier Business Review sessions with strategic and core suppliers to share knowledge and discuss performance indicators. Finally, we held several meetings to introduce a new form of cooperation to improve product design unique to Flying Tiger Copenhagen. We continuously test ideas, measure performance and collaborate with suppliers to improve our environmental, social and business performance.

Anti-corruption
Sadly, corruption is a considerable issue in international supply chains that prevents free and fair behaviour and limits sustainable development.
Our audits are strict on this aspect, and our whistleblower setup ensures anonymous reporting if needed. This year, we have continued our training for employees on the topic, and we have spoken to suppliers to underline our zero-gifting policy and plan to continue with this in 2025. In 2024, no cases of corruption or bribery were identified.

In the People Team, our main purpose is to ensure we have the right people on board to foster a productive workplace culture and develop the right competencies to meet our strategic goals.
We take pride in supporting our managers, ensuring that everyone stays engaged and motivated. Not only do we scout people with the right skills, but we also work diligently to retain all our highly qualified employees throughout our organisation - from store staff and managers to creatives and administrative teams at HQ.
Our mission is to become one unified Flying Tiger Copenhagen across all markets. To achieve this, we support our teams in building the right competencies, capabilities and values that bring our strategy to life.
Our People Team continues to evolve. In 2024, we established our Learning & Development team, which initially focused on evaluating and reviewing existing materials and programmes across markets to cultivate a global learning culture. This team also took the first steps towards a digital learning programme for our store colleagues.

Supporting Our People
People-related matters require the right support. Therefore, our Business Partners team up with committed HR professionals, both at HQ and across market offices, to provide our managers with important knowledge on recruitment, performance evaluation, team coaching and employee development. We all work closely with the business and teams to ensure that working at Flying Tiger Copenhagen delivers a great employee experience.
Our annual personal development reviews and discussions between managers and employees are important assessments.
In 2024, we launched a new development and review process. These reviews complement ongoing one-on-one meetings and the open, honest dialogue that all our people managers are encouraged to foster with their team members.

Culture: An Informal, Dynamic and Social Workplace
At Flying Tiger Copenhagen, we put our hearts into everything we do.
Our values are strongly rooted in the Scandinavian culture of openness, fun and relevance. They reflect our worldview and, in turn, shape how we think and work.
We embrace an open workplace culture where trust and respect are fundamental. We encourage everyone to engage, take charge and influence their work. Cultural diversity is a key strength. In 2024, we welcomed many new colleagues from across the globe. At HQ alone, we now have 44 different nationalities, all contributing to our unique culture, making Flying Tiger Copenhagen a truly international company. We strive for a workplace that is fun, dynamic and inclusive. Celebrations - big and small - are a part of our culture, often marked with cake, which is even one of our values!

Engagement: Ways of Working
At Flying Tiger Copenhagen, our people know that our doors are always open. To us, it is essential that everyone feels welcome in our offices, where they can share ideas and collaborate. However, to truly thrive, flexibility is key. A hybrid work model helps employees balance their work and personal lives, which is why we offer flexible and attractive working conditions, both on-site and remotely.
Our HQ is designed to be a vibrant space, complete with a newly renovated reception and lounge area, where people want to come to work and connect with colleagues. In our 2024 engagement surveys, this flexible approach was widely recognised as a contributor to employee engagement.

Well-being & Data Insights
Knowledge is power. By providing our people managers with data and insights into their teams' well-being and engagement, we equip them with the tools to foster a best-in-class and unique retail company.
In 2024, one-third of our teams across markets conducted employee satisfaction surveys. These surveys became a powerful tool for managers, helping to build a stronger feedback culture while inviting open, honest dialogue about the employee experience at Flying Tiger Copenhagen.
We launched a new initiative, Well-being Week, featuring workshops on physical wellness, a running club, a step competition and many other activities. The initiative was well received and will continue throughout the year.
To further recognise and engage our store colleagues, some markets introduced Colleague Appreciation Days - a fun initiative featuring small gifts, competitions and games to celebrate our store teams.
The latest employee satisfaction survey at HQ in 2024 showed an engagement score of 8.0 out of 10, slightly above both market and industry benchmarks as well as our own 2024 target. This result highlights our success in maintaining high engagement levels and fostering a strong feedback culture.

Diversity & Inclusion: Everyone's Welcome
Happy employees stay longer, and retention is good for business. That is why ensuring good working conditions and a welcoming environment where people feel a sense of belonging is key. Of course, we have zero tolerance for discrimination - this is both a core company value and a fundamental obligation.
Our inclusive culture gives us a competitive advantage. It meets the expectations of professionals who want to work at a company that values diversity and inclusion, allowing us to attract talent from the widest possible pool.
In 2024, we continued to work with our Diversity Panel, bringing together colleagues from across markets in various positions. This platform enables relevant discussions and drives meaningful local initiatives.

Ethics Training & Awareness:
Know How to Act & Behave
Our employee ethics training includes topics such as corruption (e.g. bribery, conflicts of interest and breaches of competition law), accurate financial reporting, gifting and hospitality.
As a result, our employees are informed and protected, knowing exactly how to act in these situations. If needed, employees can turn to our whistleblower setup, which allows for confidential reporting of any concerns.
To ensure full compliance, we introduced a system that includes an annual refresher course on our Employee Code of Ethics for both HQ and our markets.
Our engagement survey tool - used at HQ, in Shanghai, Singapore and Italy - detects selected keywords in anonymous employee comments related to harassment and discrimination. This enables management to proactively engage and address concerns.
In 2024, we introduced a global Work Behaviour Policy, developed with due diligence to foster a respectful, inclusive and productive workplace. The policy outlines expected workplace behaviour and aligns with our values and legal obligations.

People Facts & Employment Conditions
We have local offices in most markets, including regional offices in Shanghai and Singapore, and our HQ in Denmark.
In 2024, our average headcount was around 8,000 including temporary employees hired for peak seasons. Half of our markets operate under collective agreements, and 89% have formal minimum wages set by either law or collective agreements.
More than half of our markets also offer a healthcare package for employees in addition to public healthcare services, which in most of our markets are high-quality and widely accessible.
Flying Tiger Copenhagen offers equal opportunities regardless of gender, ethnicity, race, religion, or sexual orientation. At every level of the organisation, professional qualifications remain the key selection criterion.




Gender Distribution

the gender split is even more pronounced, with women comprising 80% of our total headcount and men 20%. A total of 13 employees identified as "Other" in our gender reporting for this period, equivalent to 0.1% of the total workforce. The high number of women in our stores is also reflected
at the store management level. Across our markets around 78% of the store managers are women.
We remain committed to fostering an inclusive and balanced workplace that empowers talent across all genders.

Gender Representation in Management
"Other levels of management" is defined as the Senior Leadership Team and individuals with managerial responsibility reporting directly to members of the Senior Leadership Team.
We have improved the representation of the underrepresented gender compared to 2023, where women made up 37% of this group. The original target of reaching 40% women in other levels of management by 2027 was already achieved in 2024, with women now representing 43% of these roles - contributing to a more balanced gender distribution.

In accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards, where non-controlling interests have put options that can be exercised to transfer their present ownership interest to the Parent Company, a liability is recognised corresponding to the redemption amount, and the subsidiaries are fully consolidated with no recognition of a non-controlling interest at the reporting date. Changes in the value of these liabilities, as well as differences upon settlement, are accounted for directly in equity. At 31 December 2024, the accumulated changes and differences upon settlement amount to DKK -1,204.2m (2023: DKK -1,187.0m) included in equity. The fair value of the call options on the remaining ownership interests is recognised in the balance sheet and fair value adjusted over the statement of profit or loss. Additional details on the impact are provided in note 4.2.

Zebra presents its consolidated financial statements in accordance with
IFRS(r) Accounting Standards. This section sets out Zebra's significant accounting policies, Management's key accounting estimates, new requirements according to IFRS Accounting Standards and other accounting policies in general. A detailed description of accounting policies and significant estimates related to specific reported amounts is presented in the notes to which they relate.

Transactions and balances
On initial recognition, transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recognised by the Group entities at their functional currency exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transaction. Monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates prevailing at the reporting date.
Foreign exchange adjustments are recognised in the statement of profit or loss under financial items.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date of the initial transaction. An average exchange rate for the month is used at the transaction date to the extent that it does not significantly deviate from the exchange rate at the transaction date.
Group companies with another functional currency than DKK
The assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated

Cash flow
Cash flows from operating activities are determined using the indirect method.
Cash flows from investing activities mainly comprise the purchase of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and business combinations.
Cash flows from financing activities comprise dividends paid, proceeds and repayments of loans and borrowings, repayment
of lease liabilities, changes in non-controlling interests' ownership share and share capital increases.
Cash flows in currencies other than the functional currency are translated at the average exchange rates for the month of the transaction unless these differ significantly from the rates at the transaction dates.

1.1 Material Accounting Policies

The Annual Report for the period 1 January - 31 December 2024 comprises the consolidated financial statements of the Parent Company, Zebra A/S, and the subsidiaries controlled by the Parent Company (the Group), as well as separate financial statements for the Parent Company, Zebra A/S.
On 5 June 2025, the Board of Directors and the Executive Management approved Zebra A/S's Annual Report for 2024, which will be presented to shareholders for approval at the Annual General Meeting on 5 June 2025.

Statement of compliance
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards as adopted by the EU, as well as Danish disclosure requirements applying to entities of reporting class C (large).

Basis for measurement
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Danish kroner (DKK), which is the functional currency of the Parent Company.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments, including call options and provisions for the acquisition of non-controlling interests, are measured at fair value.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. Please refer to note 1.3 Going concern.
Accounting policies
The accounting policies, as described below and in the respective notes, have been applied consistently for the financial year and are unchanged from last year apart from the implementation of new or amended standards effective from financial year 1 January - 31 December 2024, cf. below.




Accounting policies related to specific line items are described in connection with the notes to which they relate. The description of accounting policies in the notes forms part of the overall description of accounting policies. Accounting policies not directly related to a specific line item covered by a note are presented below.
Basis for consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Parent Company and its subsidiaries.
Subsidiaries controlled by the Parent Company are fully consolidated from the date on which the Parent Company obtains control and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases. Control is obtained when the Parent Company directly or indirectly owns or controls more than 50% of the voting rights in the subsidiary or has control in some other way. The financial statements of the controlled subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the Parent Company, using consistent accounting policies. All intercompany balances, income and expenses, unrealised gains and losses, and dividends resulting from intercompany transactions are eliminated in full.
Upon loss of control, the Group derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, any non-controlling interests, and the other components of equity related to the subsidiary. Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in the statement of profit or loss. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value at the date that control is lost.
Entities which by agreement are managed jointly with one or more other parties are considered joint ventures. Joint ventures are consolidated using the equity method.
Foreign currencies
Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective Group companies are considered transactions denominated in foreign currencies.

into the functional currency at the rate of exchange prevailing at the reporting date. The statements of profit or loss and the cash flow statements are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. An average exchange rate for the month is used at the transaction date to the extent that it does
not significantly deviate from the exchange rate at the transaction date. Foreign exchange adjustments arising on translation are recognised in other comprehensive income.

Consolidated statement of profit or loss
The consolidated statement of profit or loss is prepared based on cost classified by nature. Cost of sales comprises direct expenses incurred to generate revenue for the year, including cost of goods, inbound freight, test and design expenses, and customs costs. Other external expenses comprise other purchase and selling costs, as well as administrative costs and bad debt.

Equity
Currency translation reserve
The currency translation reserve comprises foreign exchange differences relating to the translation of the results and net assets of the foreign subsidiaries from their functional currencies into the presentation currency used by Zebra A/S (DKK). Translation adjustments are reclassified to profit or loss on the disposal of the foreign operation.
Currency hedging reserve
The currency hedging reserve comprises changes in the fair value of hedging transactions that qualify for recognition as cash flow hedges where the hedged transaction has not yet been realised.

Implementation of new or amended standards and interpretations
The Group has applied all the new or amended standards (IFRS) and interpretations (IFRIC) as adopted by the EU and which are effective from the financial year 1 January - 31 December 2024. The implementation of the new or amended standards has not had any material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

Standards issued but not yet effective
The IASB has issued several new IFRS standards, amended standards, revised standards and interpretations that are effective for financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2025, most significantly:
IFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements Effective from 1 January 2027, IFRS 18 Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements introduces new categories and subtotals in the statement of profit or loss, requires disclosure of management-defined performance measures, and includes new requirements for the location, aggregation and disaggregation
of financial information. IFRS 18 will not impact the recognition or measurement of items in the financial statements, but the Group expects to change the presentation of certain items, including definitions of certain required subtotals in the statement of profit or loss. The Group intends to adopt the standard on 1 January 2027 and will apply it retrospectively.
Other standards and amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group in future periods.

1.2 Significant Accounting Estimates and Judgments	1.2 Significant Accounting Estimates and Judgments (continued)


The consolidated financial statements have been prepared to give a true and fair view of the Group's assets, liabilities and financial position as of 31 December 2024 as well as the results of operations and of cash flow. The Executive Management makes various accounting estimates and judgments which affect the consolidated financial statements.
The judgments, estimates and assumptions made are based on historical experience and other factors that the Executive Management considers to be reliable but which by their very nature are associated with uncertainty and unpredictability. These assumptions may prove incomplete or incorrect, and as such, unexpected events or circumstances may arise.
The Group is subject to risks and uncertainties that may lead to actual results differing from these estimates, both positively and negatively.
Information about judgments, assumptions and estimation uncertainties that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment is included in the following notes on what the Executive Management regards as significant estimates and judgments:
Consolidation of entities in which the Group holds a 50%
ownership interest (cf. below),
Valuation of deferred tax assets (note 2.4),
Measurement, revaluation and impairment test of right-of-use assets (note 3.2),
Write-downs against the carrying amount of inventories
(note 3.5),
Assessing whether a change to the bank facilities is a termination of existing debt with recognition of new debt or a modification of existing debt (note 4.4),
Fair value measurement of call options (note 4.4),
Provisions for the acquisition of non-controlling interests
(note 4.5), and
Impairment of assets held for sale (note 5.1).
Apart from these, several other significant estimates and judgments have been applied. Please refer to the notes for further information.

Climate-related risks
The Executive Management has considered the impact of climate
change on the consolidated financial statements. The review did not identify any material financial impacts, and the Executive Management has assessed that the effects of climate change do not have significant influence on the estimates or judgments in the consolidated financial statements.
The Group takes climate-related changes very seriously and has set ambitious targets to decarbonise the value chain and to do what is possible to mitigate the negative consequences of climate change. Our business model means we have a high degree of control over our value chain, from product designs, packaging designs, product materials and testing to the logistics setup and

the running of our stores. Sustainability is an integral part of how we design our products, focusing on circular materials, minimising the use of plastic and reducing the number of single-use products. Please see the Sustainability Section for more details.
Our business model as a variety retailer with many different products and several suppliers enables us to quickly adapt to new environmental regulatory requirements, such as CO2 duties on certain products or the banning of some products and materials from the EU market.

Macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties
In 2024, the global business environment continued to be shaped by significant macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges, including the ongoing war in Ukraine, the Israel-Hamas conflict, and persistently elevated levels of inflation and interest rates.
Despite these circumstances, the Group has experienced minimal direct operational impact. The Group has no business activities
in Ukraine or Russia, and franchise stores in Israel have remained
operational throughout the regional conflict.
Inflation is generally impacting the cost base across a variety of areas, including energy, rent and labour costs. The Group has integrated strong cost control and efficiency initiatives into its day-to-day business operations to mitigate the impact.
As providing affordable products is a key aspect of the Group's strategy, the global recession is having less of an impact on trade.
Most of the Group's products are sourced from China via a number of different suppliers, but with no long-term contracts. The Group is also in the process of broadening its sourcing to other Asian countries.
While uncertainties remain around hostilities directed at shipping in the Red Sea, the Group has taken the necessary precautions to ensure that the disruption does not have a material impact on its operations.
Elevated interest rates and cost inflation have impacted certain accounting estimates and judgments in relation to impairment testing of non-current assets and the tax asset value, assessing write-downs on inventories and estimating the fair-value of call options.

Dispute with the Group's freight forwarder
From June 2021 to May 2022, the Group's former freight forwarder charged sea freight rates above those that were contractually agreed. The Group initiated legal proceedings before the Danish Maritime and Commercial High Court ("Sø- og Handelsretten") on 1 March 2022. In August 2024, the dispute was settled out of court.

Consolidation of entities in which the Group holds a 50% ownership interest
The Group considers several entities to be under its control even though it does not hold the majority of the voting rights in the entities. Assessing whether the Group controls an entity is based on whether the Group has the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the entity. The Group holds call options to acquire all remaining outstanding shares, including the voting rights related to these shares. All call options are currently exercisable.

Zebra A/S has also entered into shareholder agreements (partnership agreements) with the other investors (partners) as well as supply agreements, etc. that give Zebra A/S substantial rights, including in connection with a deadlocked situation.
Accordingly, the Group considers that these potential voting rights and other rights in all substance give rise to the existence of control at the reporting date.

Non-controlling interests
Non-controlling interests in the results and equity of subsidiaries are shown separately in the consolidated statement of profit or


1.3 Going Concern
The reported equity was negative at the end of 2024 at
DKK 1,379m (2023: DKK 1,353m) for the Group and
DKK 760m (2023: DKK 591m) for the Parent Company, meaning the registered share capital has been fully lost. Reference is made to the section 'Negative reported Equity/financial position for the Group and the Parent Company' in the 'Operating and financial review 2024' on pages 23-27.

loss, statement of comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity, and the balance sheet. The Group treats transactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in a loss of control as transactions with equity owners of the Group.
The non-controlling ownership interest, which is subject to the put option, is reclassified as a liability at the end of the reporting period, as if the acquisition took place at that date. Any difference between the exercise price of the put option and the net assets allocated to the non-controlling interest is recognised as an adjustment to retained earnings.




It is the Executive Management and the Board of Directors' assessment that the Group is able to continue as a going concern, and accordingly the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.

Accounting policies
The Group operates a chain of retail stores selling a wide range of affordable products within categories that include home, kitchen, hobby and party, toys, electronics and gadgets, foods and accessories. The same products are also sold through our e-commerce channel.
Revenue from the sale of the goods is recognised when a Group entity sells a product to a customer, or the product is delivered from our online store, and thereby transfers control of the goods to the customer.


The Group has implemented a franchise setup where the Group sells the same products to franchise partners. Revenue is recognised when control of the products has been transferred to the franchisees. Transfer of control of the products occurs when
the products have been delivered to the franchise partner and no further obligation exists that can affect the transfer of control.
Delivery has taken place when the franchise partner has collected the products from one of the Group's central warehouses. Revenue from the sale is recognised based on the price specified in the contract. The payment terms for the


2.2 Staff Costs
Accounting policies
Salaries and wages, social security contributions, leave and sick leave, bonuses and non-monetary benefits are recognised in the period in which employees of the Group render the services.







Termination benefits are recognised at the time an agreement between the Group and the employee is made and the employee, in exchange for the benefits, no longer provides services for the Group.

The Group's sales to customers are cash sales without any variable consideration elements. Payment of the transaction price is due immediately when the customer purchases the goods and takes delivery in the store or upon delivery from our online store.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received, excluding discounts, rebates, sales taxes and duties.
A provision of DKK 1.3m (2023: DKK 1.0m) has been recognised for returned goods.

franchise partners are 14-30 calendar days from the franchisee's receipt of such invoices. The price is not adjusted for any financing elements as payment terms never exceed 12 months.
A receivable is recognised when control has been transferred, as the consideration to be paid is conditional only on the passage of time. Except for damage claims, the franchisees have no rights of return.
The figures below include franchise fees and royalties of DKK 49.3m (2023: DKK 26.2m).

During 2024, the Key Management Personnel have entered into a long-term incentive programme. The value of the programme is recognised over an expected period of 7 years conditional on continued employment. As of 31 December 2024, Zebra A/S had a payable amount to the Key Management Personnel of DKK 16.9m related to the long-term incentive programme.

Accounting policies
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. No deferred tax is recognised for goodwill unless amortisation of goodwill for tax purposes is allowed.
Deferred tax is measured on the basis of the tax rules and the tax rate enacted in the respective countries at the balance sheet date.
Changes in deferred tax due to tax rate changes are recognised in the statement of profit or loss, except to the extent that
they relate to items recognised either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Significant accounting estimates and judgments
The Group recognises deferred tax assets, including the expected tax value of tax losses carried forward, if the Executive Management assesses that these tax assets can be offset against positive taxable income within the Group's budgeting period that exceeds realisation of deferred tax liabilities. The Executive Management assesses tax assets and liabilities at least annually based on dialogue with tax advisors and business plans for the coming years, including other planned commercial initiatives.


The Executive Management considers it probable that an amount of DKK 118.0m (2023: DKK 91.0m) in tax assets can be offset against positive taxable income within the next five to seven years, while an amount of DKK 561.1m (2023: DKK 525.3m) in tax assets has been impaired at year-end 2024. The impairment test at year-end 2024 resulted in a profit or loss effect amounting to a loss of DKK 36.4m (2023: a loss of DKK 50.2m). The tax asset
is impairment tested on a per entity basis, including expected income for the entity for the period 2025 to 2031.
However, the amount of tax assets not shown in the balance sheet can still be carried forward to be offset against future taxable income after the budgeting period. Of the total deferred tax assets recognised, DKK 60.0m (2023: DKK 43.1m) is related to tax loss carry-forwards.
Pillar Two legislation
Pillar Two legislation has been enacted or substantively enacted in certain jurisdictions in which the Group operates. However, this legislation does not apply to the Group, as its consolidated revenue is lower than EUR 750m.



2.3 Special Items


Accounting policies
Special items include significant income and expenses of a non-recurring nature which cannot be attributed directly to the Group's ordinary operating activities. Such income and expenses relate to the significant restructuring of processes, fundamental structural adjustments, as well as gains or losses arising in connection with this that are significant over time. Furthermore, special items also include other litigation costs.


These items are classified separately in the statement of profit or loss in order to provide a more transparent view of the Group's recurring operating profit.

3.1 Intangible Assets	3.1 Intangible Assets (continued)


Accounting policies
Goodwill
Goodwill is initially recognised at the amount by which the purchase price for a business combination exceeds the recognised value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities. Subsequent to initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less impairment losses.
Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Amortisation is carried out systematically over the expected useful lives of the assets:
Trademarks; 5-20 years
Licenses and software; a maximum of 5 years
Group-wide software developed for internal use; a maximum of 10 years
Group-wide software developed for internal use includes external costs to consultants, licenses and software as well as internal costs related to the development and are included in Licenses and software.
Intangible assets in progress and assets with an indefinite useful life are measured at cost less impairment losses.

Significant accounting estimates and judgments
At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing of an asset is required, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the asset.
Goodwill
Goodwill relates primarily to the acquisition of a few Danish stores in the period 2006 to 2011 and the acquisition of J.H.L. ApS in 2015.
The carrying amount of goodwill is tested annually for impairment. The recoverable amount is calculated as the present value of future net cash flows (value-in-use) from the activity to which the goodwill is allocated.
The estimate of the future free net cash flows is based on budgets for 2025 approved by the Board of Directors.
No growth rate is assumed for the following years.


Key parameters are revenue development, profit margins, capital expenditures and growth expectations for the following years. Key factors that could trigger an impairment test include a macroeconomic slowdown and changes to the competitive environment.
A pre-tax discount rate of 10.9% (2023: 11.3%) is used to calculate recoverable amounts, representing the weighted average cost of capital. The discount rate reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
The impairment test of goodwill resulted in a recognition of an impairment loss of DKK 0.6m (2023: DKK 0).
Development projects in progress
For development projects in progress, including assets being developed internally, the Executive Management estimates on an ongoing basis whether each project is likely to generate future economic benefits for the Group in order to qualify
for recognition. The development projects are evaluated on technical as well as commercial criteria. In the Executive
Management's opinion, the development projects qualify for recognition.
The carrying amount of development projects in progress is tested annually for impairment. The impairment test is based on various factors, including future use of the project, the fair value of estimated future earnings or savings, interest rates and risks described in the Goodwill section referring to the key parameters and pre-tax discount rate. The impairment test of development projects in progress did not show any need for impairment losses to be recognised in 2024 (2023: DKK 0).
Licenses and software and other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life
Licenses and software include a carrying amount of DKK 159.2m (2023: DKK 148.8m) related to the Group's IT backbone system. The remaining amortisation period is 4 years. Further, licenses and software include a carrying amount of DKK 3.6m (2023: DKK 3.6m) related to REACH authorisations, which are considered to have an indefinite useful life as they are valid for an indefinite period of time.
Other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are tested annually for impairment. The impairment test is based on various factors described in the Goodwill section referring to the key parameters and pre-tax discount rate, including future use of the authorisations. The impairment test did not show any need for impairment losses to be recognised in 2024
(2023: DKK 0).

3.2 Right-of-use Assets and Lease Liabilities	3.2 Right-of-use Assets and Lease Liabilities (continued)


Accounting policies
The Group has applied IFRS 16 to lease contracts related to store premises, offices, cars, store furniture and other equipment.
The Group has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and liabilities for leases of low-value assets and short-term leases (i.e. expiry within 12 months). The Group recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
The Group has a large number of individual leases, primarily related to leasing of store premises and offices. Lease terms vary between markets and can range from a defined few years to rolling contracts without a defined end date. Additionally, several lease contracts include extension and/or termination options. Most of the lease contracts include mechanisms for rent
adjustments, either as a fixed percentage increase, an adjustment based on local price indices, or as the result of market rent reviews. Many store-related lease contracts also include variable rent based on revenue.
Right-of-use assets
Right-of-use assets are initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liabilities adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to restore the underlying asset, less any lease incentives received.
When the lease liabilities are remeasured, (please see section 'Lease liabilities'), a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use assets.
Right-of-use assets are depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the end of the lease term. In addition, right-of-use assets are periodically reduced by any impairment losses.
Lease liabilities
The Group initially measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the Group's incremental borrowing rate
as per the commencement date.
The Group determines its incremental borrowing rate by adjusting the interest from various external financing sources by factors specific to the market related to the lease contract.
The Group assesses at the lease commencement date whether it is reasonably certain to exercise extension or termination options. If there is a significant event, or significant changes in circumstances within the Group's control, the Group reassesses whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the options.
Lease payments include fixed payments, variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate, and payments of penalties for terminating the lease if the lease term reflects the Group exercising that option.
The lease liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an
index or a rate, if the Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise an extension or a termination option, or if there is a revised in-substance fixed lease payment.

Significant accounting estimates and judgments
Life of lease
When assessing the life of the leases, the Group considers the options where the Group is reasonably certain to either terminate or extend the contracts based on the profitability level of the store. The lease period varies depending on whether the contract has any termination and extension options. Approximately 70% of the property lease contracts have such options. The average life of lease at balance sheet date was approximately 2.5 years
(2023: 2.5 years).
Right-of-use assets
At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing of an asset is required, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the asset.
The Group has considered the recoverability of right-of-use assets for loss making stores and CGUs with low EBIT margins based on the budget for 2025 and business plans and projections for the following years.
Country-specific pre-tax discount rates in the range of 10.9% - 14.1% (2023: 11.2% - 15.8%) are used to calculate recoverable amounts, representing the weighted average cost of capital. The discount rates reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
The impairment test of right-of-use assets resulted in the recognition of impairment losses of DKK 11.4m relating to stores in Finland, Norway, the Netherlands, France, and Malta
(2023: DKK 11.3m).
Prior year impairment losses of DKK 0.5m (2023: DKK 9.8m) have been reversed in 2024, as no impairment indicators existed
at year-end for the relevant CGUs due to improved expected profitability.
The application of IFRS 16 requires the Group to make judgments that affect the valuation of the lease liabilities and right-of-use assets. This includes determining the contracts in scope of
IFRS 16, the contract terms and the interest rate used for discounting the cash flows.
The lease terms determined by the Group generally comprise non-cancellable periods of lease contracts, periods covered by an option to extend the lease if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option, and periods covered by an option to terminate the lease if the Group is reasonably certain not to exercise the option.
Lease liabilities
The maturity analysis is based on all undiscounted cash flows, including estimated interest payments, which are estimated based on current market conditions.

Accounting policies
Property, plant and equipment is measured at cost less accumulated depreciations and impairment losses. Cost comprises the acquisition price, costs directly attributable to the acquisition, and the preparation costs of the asset until the time when it is ready for its intended use.
The basis of depreciation is cost less estimated residual value after the shorter of estimated useful life or the terms of respective leases, if applicable.

Significant accounting estimates and judgments
If there is any indication that an asset may be impaired, the value-in-use of the asset is estimated and compared with the current value. The value-in-use calculation is based on the discounted cash flow method using estimates of future cash flows from the continuing use of the asset. The key parameters are expected utilisation of the asset, expected growth in cash flow in the terminal period, etc. All these parameters are based on estimates of the future and may give rise to changes in future accounting periods.

Where parts of an item have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.
Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method based on the following estimated useful lives of the assets:
Leasehold improvements; Lease term or a maximum of 10 years Store furniture; a maximum of 5 years
Other fixtures and equipment; 3-5 years
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date.

Estimates are required to assess the useful lives of tangible assets. These assumptions are based on the Executive Management's best estimate of the useful life of the asset and its residual value at the end of its useful life.
The Group has considered the recoverability of tangible assets for loss making stores and CGUs with low EBIT margins based on the budget for 2025 and business plans and projections for the following years.
Country-specific pre-tax discount rates in the range of 10.9% - 14.1% (2023: 11.2% - 15.8%) are used to calculate recoverable amounts, representing the weighted average cost of capital. The discount rates reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
The impairment test of property, plant and equipment resulted in the recognition of an impairment loss of DKK 1.6m relating to stores in Finland, Norway, the Netherlands, France, and Malta (2023: DKK 4.4m). No prior year impairment losses have been reversed in 2024 (2023: DKK 0).


The total cash outflow for leases in 2024 was DKK 784.4m (2023: DKK 748.4m).
At 31 December 2024, the Group had commitments of DKK 3.9m for short-term and low-value leases (2023: DKK 3.4m).
The effect of COVID-19-related rent concessions in 2024 was DKK 0.1m (2023: DKK 0.2m), which has been included in other external expenses.

Inventories consist of finished goods purchased for resale and include costs incurred in bringing the goods to their existing location and condition, e.g. delivery costs as well as freight and handling costs. Inventories are measured at the lower of cost using the FIFO method and the net realisable value.
The net realisable value of inventories is calculated as the estimated selling price less costs incurred to execute sales.

Significant accounting estimates and judgments
The value used as the lower of cost and the net realisable value is subject to the effects of customer demands and preferences as well as the broader economy. These effects are not controllable by the Executive Management.

The Executive Management continuously reviews inventory levels to identify obsolete and slow-moving inventory items, as these factors can indicate a decline in inventory value. Estimates are required with respect to assessing future customer demands and preferences as well as the broader economy.
The reversal of DKK 10.9m (2023: DKK 24.5m) in the provision for write-downs is driven by products being life-extended.
At 31 December 2024, inventory write-downs amount to DKK 36.1m (2023: DKK 88.8m).

3.6 Other Provisions	3.7 Post-employment Benefits


Accounting policies
Provisions are made for obligations to restore leased premises to their original condition at the end of the respective lease terms. The corresponding costs are capitalised as part of the cost of right-of-use assets and are depreciated over the term of the lease.


Furthermore, provisions are made for infringement litigations and for obligations in connection with salvage costs.

Accounting policies
The Group has several post-employment benefits of which the majority are defined contribution pension plans with no further payment obligation once the contributions are paid. Payable defined contribution plans are included in current liabilities under other payables.
The Group also has a defined benefit pension plan where the responsibility towards the employees rests with the Group.


The Group assumes the risk associated with future developments in wages, interest rates and inflation.

Defined benefit plan in the Italian subsidiary
The Group's defined benefit plan is in the Italian subsidiary. The obligation is paid by the Group in case of termination, retirement, etc. of the employees. No additional liabilities exist for the Group after fulfilling this obligation.

Other provisions relate mainly to restoration obligations in connection with vacating leased premises, but also include an estimated contribution to damage and salvage costs from a fire on the container carrier Maersk Honam in March 2018.

The Group's obligation in respect of the defined benefit plan is the present value of the obligation of future benefits that
employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.
The defined benefit plan is unfunded.
The defined benefit plan costs are calculated based on actuarial estimates and financial expectations. Service costs are recognised in staff costs and interest is recognised in financial expenses. Actuarial gains and losses due to changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in other comprehensive income.

Significant accounting estimates and judgments
The value of the Group's defined benefit plan is based on valuations from an external actuary using the projected credit method to determine the present value of the obligation. The calculations and valuation are performed annually and are based on a number of actuarial assumptions, including discount rate, expected growth in wages and demographic assumptions such as employee turnover and mortality.

The actuarial calculations for 2024 led to an increase in the liability and an actuarial loss of DKK 3.2m recognised in other comprehensive income (2023: a loss of DKK 0.8m).

Sensitivity analysis
The analysis is based on changes in assumptions that the Group considered to be reasonably possible at the reporting date.
The most significant assumptions used in the calculation of the obligation for the defined benefit plan are the discount rate and the wages growth rate.

The sensitivity analysis showed that a 0.25 percentage point increase/decrease in the discount rate would result in a change of DKK -2.0m/DKK +2.1m (2023: DKK -2.0m/DKK +2.0m) in the
obligation. A 0.5 percentage point increase/decrease in the wages growth rate would result in a change of DKK +0.6m/ DKK -0.5m (2023: DKK +0.6m/DKK -0.6m) in the obligation.

certain fully consolidated entities where local partners have an ownership interest of 50%, cf. note 1.2.
For these entities, the Group has entered into put and call options with the non-controlling interests. The put option gives the non-controlling shareholder the right to sell their non- controlling interests to the Group at a defined exercise price, cf. note 4.5. In accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards, put options on shareholdings held by non-controlling interests are included as a provision in the financial statements until
exercised or lapsed. Consequently, no non-controlling interests
(minority interests) for these fully consolidated entities are

measured at fair value with adjustments over profit or loss from 1 January 2018 according to IFRS 9.
A number of call and put options have been exercised, giving rise to the recognition of deferred considerations or cash outflows for the acquisition of non-controlling interests. Under the accounting policies of the Group, changes in the value of these liabilities, including differences upon settlement, are accounted for as a transaction directly in equity.

Accounting policies
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment.
Loans and receivables are assessed for indicators of impairment at the end of each reporting period. For loans and receivables that are subject to IFRS 9, the expected credit loss model is applied to calculate impairment losses over the life of the receivables.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprises short-term cash in hand, bank deposits and credit card receivables less any drawings on credit facilities that are an integral part of the cash management.
Lease liabilities
Lease liabilities are measured at amortised cost. Lease payments are allocated between lease liabilities and finance expenses so that a constant rate of interest is recognised on the outstanding finance balance. Please see note 3.2 for further information.
Loans from shareholders
Loans from shareholders consist of separate loans. The Loan from shareholders under non-current liabilities in the balance sheet
is unsecured and does not carry any interests or instalments. The loan is subordinated to the Group's existing bank facilities.
The loans included in Loans from shareholders under current liabilities in the balance sheet accrue interest of 6% per annum. The interest for 2024 amounts to DKK 3.2m and has been added to the principal amount. The loans are subordinated to the Group's existing bank facilities.
Bank debt and other financial liabilities
Bank debt and other financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value less transaction costs and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The
difference between proceeds and the nominal value is recognised as a financial expense over the term of the loan. Other debt is recognised at amortised costs.


If the terms of a loan are modified, this is considered to result in an extinguishment of the initial borrowing. The cash flows of the modified borrowing are discounted at the original interest rate and an immediate loss is recognised in profit or loss at the date of the modification.
Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments consist of currency instruments such as forward contracts, interest and currency swaps, options and similar products, as well as call options on the
non-controlling shareholdings. Please see note 4.4 for further information.
Financial assets and liabilities are accounted for at settlement date.

Significant accounting estimates and judgments
Bank debt
Bank facilities were renegotiated in June 2024. The Executive Management assessed the terms and conditions of the new bank facilities and concluded these to be substantially different from the original bank facilities. As a result, the existing debt has been terminated and new debt has been recognised. A majority part of the bank debt is classified as short term due to a breach of financial covenant on 31 December 2024. Please see note 4.4 for further information.
Maturity analysis
The maturity analysis is based on all undiscounted cash flows, including estimated interest payments, which are estimated based on current market conditions.
The undiscounted cash flows from derivative financial instruments are presented in gross amounts, and the contractual cash flows for the acquisition of non-controlling interests are based on estimated redemption amounts, as set out in note 4.5.

4.3 Financial Assets and Liabilities (continued)	4.4 Financial Risk Management (continued)


Financial risk management
The nature of the Group's operations, investments and financing exposes the Group to financial risks in the form of fluctuations
in foreign exchange rates and interest levels, as well as credit risks and liquidity risks. The financial risks are monitored and managed by Zebra's Group Treasury. Please see note 4.4 for further information.



4.4 Financial Risk Management


The Group's general policy toward financial risks is to proactively address them in order to mitigate the risk of material impacts on the financial situation of the Group, which could negatively influence operations. It is the Group's policy to not engage in active speculation with regard to financial risks.

Call options on the remaining ownership interests in certain subsidiaries
The fair value adjustment includes the effect from the change in the estimated present value of the expected cash outflows to purchase the remaining ownerships as well as the change in the market multiples.
The fair value of the call options on the remaining ownership interests in certain subsidiaries has been included in the line item Derivative financial instruments under non-current assets.



In 2024 and 2023, Zebra A/S did not exercise any call options, and no call options expired without being exercised.


Accounting policies
The Group is exposed to financial risks due to the nature of its operating, investing and financing activities. The primary financial risks are currency risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, funding risk and credit risk. Financial risks are monitored and
managed by Group Treasury based on the treasury policy, which is reviewed and approved annually by the Board of Directors.
It is Group policy to not take speculative positions. Currency and interest rate risks are managed by the use of interest rate and currency instruments, such as forward contracts, interest rate



Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the same period as the effect from the hedged items. Initially, hedging gains and losses are included in the cost of inventory, which subsequently affects profit or loss through cost of sales.
Hedging instruments that do not satisfy the conditions for treatment as hedging instruments are measured at their fair value, with fair value adjustments being recognised on an ongoing basis in the statement of profit or loss under financial income or financial expenses.

Call options on the remaining ownership interests in certain subsidiaries
The Parent Company is granted call options on the non- controlling interests. These options are measured at fair value through profit or loss.
Hedging instruments
The Group designates certain derivatives as cash flow hedges of highly probable forecasted future transactions related
to procurement. At inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the economic relationship between hedge instruments and the hedged items, including whether changes in the cash flow of the hedging instruments are expected to offset changes in the cash flows of hedged items.
On initial recognition, financial instruments are measured at fair value as of the transaction date. After initial recognition, the financial instruments are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date. The fair value of financial instruments is measured in accordance with level 2 (observable data) of the fair value


Significant accounting estimates and judgments
The fair value of the call options is equal to the estimated market value of the underlying asset at the balance sheet date less the estimated exercise price of the call option, assuming notice of exercise is given at the balance sheet date.
The estimated exercise price of the call option is based on the same assumptions and calculation methods used for estimating the value of the provision for acquisition of non-controlling interests, cf. note 4.5.
The fair value of the call options is based on input measured in accordance with level 3 (non-observable data) in the fair
value hierarchy using projected results derived from approved budgets and agreed EBITDA multiple.
The fair value of the call options at effective transfer date might




It is the Group's policy to hedge approximately 90%, 80%, 70% and 60% of the currency risk associated with procurement
for own stores for the following 1-3 months, 4-6 months, 7-9 months, and 10-12 months respectively. It is also policy to fully hedge confirmed future payments related to procurement.
Procurement for the Franchise business is not hedged.

Hence, all open foreign exchange contracts at 31 December 2024 have a maturity of less than one year.

hierarchy. The derivatives are not traded on an active market based on quoted prices but, rather, are individual contracts. The fair value of these contracts is determined using valuation techniques that utilise market-based data such as exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk and volatilities. The positive or negative fair value of derivatives is recognised in the balance sheet.
The Group designates both the change in the spot component as well as the forward element of the contract as the hedging instrument. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of financial instruments classified as and satisfying the conditions for effective hedging of future transactions is recognised in other comprehensive income.

The put option is utilised rather than the call option, or
The actual results of the respective subsidiary companies vary from the Executive Management's projections.
The value of the call option is sensitive to developments in the future expected cash flows in the respective subsidiaries. If the future expected cash flows of all subsidiaries where Zebra A/S holds a call option increase/decrease by 5%, the value at the balance sheet date will change by DKK +28.3m/DKK -28.3m (2023: DKK +20.1m /DKK -20.1m).

The forward exchange contracts are denominated in the same currency as the highly probable future inventory purchases (USD), which is why the hedge ratio is 1:1.

Currency exposure
The Group's most material exchange rate risk is exposure to the purchase of goods invoiced in USD. The Group's exposure to currency fluctuations in foreign subsidiaries is, to some extent, mitigated by the fact that both the revenue and local costs
of the individual subsidiaries are denominated in the same currencies. Exposure to currency fluctuations in subsidiaries primarily relates to the purchase of goods from Zebra A/S in DKK by the foreign subsidiaries. The statement of profit or loss is affected by changes in exchange rates, as the profit of foreign subsidiaries is translated into Danish kroner using average exchange rates.


An average exchange rate for the month is used at the transaction date to the extent that this does not significantly deviate from the exchange rate at the transaction date.
Please find below a table showing the impact on profit for the year and equity from changes in the Group's primary currencies adjusted for hedge accounting:

Hedge ineffectiveness
The Group enters into hedge relationships whereby the critical terms of the hedging instrument match exactly with the terms of the hedged item. The Group therefore performs a qualitative assessment of effectiveness. Ineffectiveness may arise if the timing of the forecasted transaction changes from what was originally estimated.







Due to late order cancellations and postponements a small hedge ineffectiveness in 2024 of DKK 0.3m (2023: DKK 0.2m) has been reclassified from other comprehensive income to financial Items in profit or loss.

The analysis is based on monetary assets and liabilities as of the end of 2024 and 2023. The movements arise from monetary items (cash, borrowings, receivables, payables and hedging instruments) where the functional currency of the entity is different to the currency that the monetary items are denominated in.




Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk due to entities in the Group borrowing funds at variable interest rates. The risk is monitored by Group Treasury in order to maintain an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings.
Hedging activities are evaluated regularly to ensure alignment with interest rate views and defined risk appetite, ensuring that the most cost-effective hedging strategies are applied.
The Group's interest-bearing financial assets are limited to cash holdings.
Interest-bearing financial liabilities relate to bank loans and borrowings, loans provided by shareholders of non-controlling interests, and lease liabilities, as set out in note 4.3.
The sensitivity analysis below has been calculated based on the exposure to interest rates of financial instruments at the end of the reporting period. For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming that the amount of the outstanding liability at the end of the reporting period was outstanding for the whole year.
A change in interest levels will impact the Group's cash holdings, bank debt and borrowings that are subject to variable interest rates. An increase in interest levels of 1 percentage point annually compared to the interest rates at 31 December 2024


would have a negative impact of DKK 16.3m on the Group's profit for the year and equity (2023: negative impact of
DKK 17.1m). A corresponding decrease in interest levels would have a positive impact of DKK 16.3m on the Group's profit for the year and equity (2023: positive impact of DKK 17.1m).

Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk results from the potential inability of the Group to cover its financial liabilities with cash. Please refer to notes
1.3 and 4.3. Group Treasury, responsible for monitoring and mitigating liquidity risk, ensures that adequate liquidity resources are available to the Group. The Group's liquid reserves consist of cash, and undrawn committed and uncommitted credit facilities.
The availability of cash and cash equivalents held in subsidiaries that are less than 100% owned by the Group is restricted to
the extent that non-controlling interests in the respective subsidiaries hold dividend rights over available liquidity.
Group bank facilities were renegotiated and restructured in June 2025 to support the long-term business plan.
In mid of June 2025, Zebra will receive in total DKK 1,390.0m in capital contribution of which DKK 1,240.0m will be used to repay existing bank loans and DKK 150m will be kept as additional liquidity. After completing the restructuring, the total interest-

bearing bank debt and credit facility left in Zebra A/S amounts to DKK 1,185.0m. Further, amendments include a modified amortisation plan with no instalment until June 2028.
The new credit facility is subject to normal undertakings, a financial covenant and other restrictions. Financial covenant consists of a leverage covenant. Financial covenant is calculated on a last twelve months' basis. The leverage covenant applies from September 2025 and onwards. In the event of default under the credit facility agreement, debt including accrued interest could be declared immediately due and payable.

Funding risk
Zebra A/S breached a leverage ratio covenant on the old credit facility per 31 December 2024. The book value of the relevant loans was DKK 2,116.0m and has been classified as current liabilities. The terms of the loans have since been renegotiated as described above.
The Group's new credit facilities have a covenant, which is customary for such facilities. Should the Group fail to comply with the covenant, the lenders may terminate the credit facilities post an applicable remedy period. The covenant is monitored and reported on a regular basis, enabling the Group to act proactively, if required.
Credit risk
The Group's sales to customers are mainly cash sales, which limits the credit risk in the Group. The Group has implemented a franchise setup which in time will expose the Group to higher

credit risk. The franchisees are large well-funded partners, and the Executive Management has assessed the credit risk to be low in 2024 and 2023.
According to the Group's policy, cash can only be placed in bank deposits with banks with the highest credit rating. Fully owned subsidiaries can place surplus cash with Zebra A/S, either through a cash pool setup or directly with Zebra A/S outside of a cash pool.

Optimising the capital structure
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of the net interest- bearing debt and equity of the Group, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings.
The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.

Accounting policies
The Group has entered into put and call options with the non- controlling interests of certain Group entities. The put option gives the non-controlling shareholders the right to sell their non-controlling interest to the Group at a defined exercise price that reflects an EBITDA multiple. At the same time, Zebra A/S has call options on the non-controlling shareholdings with exercise prices reflecting EBITDA multiples that differ from those relevant for the aforementioned put options.
Provisions for the acquisition of non-controlling interests are measured at fair value in accordance with the anticipated acquisition method, i.e. as if the put options have been exercised at year-end in the current financial year. The fair value is determined by means of the estimated present value of the expected cash outflows to settle the put options, or the call options where Zebra A/S has exercised its call options. The fair value is measured in accordance with level 3 (non-observable data) in the fair value hierarchy and is based on projected results derived from the approved budget, agreed EBITDA multiples, and assuming that the put options are exercised by the non- controlling interests at year-end in the current financial year.
In line with the nature of the put options, the liabilities are classified as non-current liabilities, except for payments due within one year of the exercised options, which are classified as current liabilities. Changes in the value of these liabilities, as well as differences upon settlement between the actual cash outflow and the expected cash outflows, are accounted for as a transaction directly in equity.
The subsidiaries whose non-controlling shareholdings are

Significant accounting estimates and judgments
Exercise prices are determined by contractually defined EBITDA multiples for both the put and call options, and are calculated on realised financial figures for two financial years adjusted
for the net interest-bearing debt and normalised net working capital adjustments as of the effective date.
The calculation of the provisions for the put options is based on the general assumption that all the local partners exercise their put options at year-end in the current financial year with the contractually determined notice period of 12 months.
In accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards, the put option on shareholdings held by non-controlling interests is included as a provision in the financial statements as the estimated present value of the expected cash outflows to settle the liability based on projected results and on the mentioned general assumption on collective exercise at 31 December 2024.
The actual cash outflows might materially vary from the valuation of the provisions for the acquisition of non-controlling interests if:
The timing of the actual acquisition of the non-controlling interest differs from the assumptions applied,
The additional ownership interest is acquired by exercise of the aforementioned call option rather than the non-controlling shareholders' respective put option, or

5.1 Assets Held for Sale



Accounting policies
The Group classifies non-current assets and disposal groups as held for sale if it is highly probable that their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
Non-current assets are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. Once classified as held for sale, assets are not amortised or depreciated. Impairment losses on initial classification as held for sale, and subsequent gains and losses on remeasurement are recognised in the statement of profit or loss and disclosed in this note.
Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale are presented in separate lines in the statement of financial position and the main elements are specified in this note. Comparative figures are not adjusted.
A discontinued operation is a component of the Group's business which can be clearly distinguished from the rest of the Group and that either has been disposed of, or is classified as held for sale, and:
Represents a separate major line of business or geographic area of operations;
Is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographic area of operations; or
Is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.

Classification as a discontinued operation occurs at the earlier of disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be held for sale.
In the statement of profit or loss, discontinued operations are excluded from the results of continuing operations and presented separately as profit/loss for the year from discontinued operations.
Cash flows from discontinued operations are included in the Groups cash flow statement.

Significant accounting estimates and judgments
The carrying amount of assets held for sale is tested for impairment at the date of reclassification to assets held for sale. The Executive Management assesses whether the expected sales consideration can recover the net assets of the operations held for sale.
The fair value of the assets held for sale is measured in accordance with level 3 (non-observable data) in the fair value hierarchy.
Flying Tiger Korea Co., Ltd.
On 29 February 2024, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Flying Tiger Korea Co., Ltd. for a cash consideration of DKK 0.0m (1 EUR). Flying Tiger Korea Co., Ltd. is a formerly 50% owned subsidiary which was sold to the former partner in 2020 and continued as a franchise business. As part of a strategic initiative to continue the business in South Korea with a new franchise partner, the Group acquired the subsidiary exclusively with a view to resale and the subsidiary was immediately classified as held for sale. The subsidiary has therefore been presented as discontinued operations in the statement of profit or loss and the associated assets and liabilities have been classified as held for sale in the balance sheet. A sales process was initiated at acquisition.
Assets acquired mainly consisted of inventories (DKK 8.4m), trade receivables (DKK 2.3m), right-of-use assets (DKK 12.3m), and liabilities consisted of a bank loan (DKK 5.2m), lease liabilities (DKK 12.3m), and other liabilities related to the stores (DKK 5.5m). The fair value of the trade receivables amounts to DKK 2.3m. The gross amount of trade receivables is DKK 2.3m and it is expected that the full contractual amounts can be collected. No goodwill was recognised from the acquisition.
Net cash acquired in the subsidiary amounted to DKK 0.4m. The consideration transferred was DKK 0.0m (1 EUR) resulting in net cash flow on acquisition of DKK 0.4m.

Costs relating to the acquisition were immaterial and has been recognised as other external expenses in the statement of profit or loss.
From the date of acquisition, Flying Tiger Korea Co., Ltd. contributed with revenue of DKK 28.6m and with a loss of DKK 8.1m to the result for the Group. This is presented as Loss for the year from discontinued operations in the statement of
profit or loss. If the business combination had taken place at the beginning of the year, the South Korean subsidiary would have contributed with revenue of DKK 34.0m and with a loss of
DKK 11.9m.



5.2 Fees to Statutory Auditor

Due to expected low future profitability of the entity and expected sales consideration, the impairment test resulted in an impairment loss of DKK 10.0m. The impairment loss was
recognised in profit or loss under the line item Loss for the year from discontinued operations.
At 31 December 2024, the assets held for sale amounted to DKK 12.8m and liabilities directly associated with assets classified as held for sale amounted to DKK 12.8m.
The sales process of Flying Tiger Korea Co., Ltd. during 2024 and 2025 did not result in a sale and the Group closed all activities in South Korea in the first half of 2025.

The ultimate parent of the Group is Treville X Partners ApS, c/o Treville & Co. A/S, Kongens Nytorv 22, 4., 1050 Copenhagen K.
Treville X Holding ApS holds a claim against Zebra A/S for DKK 125.0m. The loan is unsecured and does not carry any
interests or instalments. The loan is subordinated to the Group's existing bank facilities. The loan is included in Loan from shareholders under non-current liabilities in the balance sheet.












In 2024, the shareholders granted Zebra A/S shareholder loans of DKK 100.0m. The loans expire at 31 December 2025 where they must be repaid in full. The loans accrue interest of 6% per annum. The interest for 2024 amounts to DKK 3.2m and has been added to the principal amount. The loans are included in Loans from shareholders under current liabilities in the balance sheet.

Balances and transactions between Zebra A/S and its subsidiaries, which are related parties of Zebra A/S, have been eliminated during consolidation and are not disclosed in this note. Details of transactions between the Group and other related parties are as follows:


Legal disputes
In 2025, the Group received a preliminary decision from the Danish Tax Agency regarding Danish excise taxes for plastic and paper bags (Emballageafgiftsloven) for the years 2018 to 2024. The Danish Tax Agency states in their opinion that the Group should pay an additional amount of DKK 7.1m in excise taxes.
This amount is expensed in Special items in the statement of profit or loss. The final claim may increase due to interest and potential penalties. The Group is disputing the claim by the Danish Tax Agency.

Litigations
A few legal proceedings and claims still pending are not expected to result in significant losses for the Group, other than what has been provided for in the financial statements.

Other guarantees
The Group has provided a guarantee to the joint venture Zebra Japan K.K.'s bank, which amounts to a maximum of DKK 62.8m (2023: DKK 69.2m). On 31 December 2024, the guaranteed amount constituted DKK 62.8m (2023: DKK 69.2m).
The Group has assessed the fair value of the issued financial guarantee and the subsequent possible loss allowance arising from the issued financial guarantee. Based on an assessment of the probability of potential cash outflow resulting from the issued financial guarantee, the Group has assessed probability to be minimal and not recognised the issued financial guarantee in the balance sheet. The disclosed guarantee represented the potential maximum cash outflow resulting from the issued guarantee.


Contractual obligations
Contractual obligations related to service contracts amounted to DKK 39.0m (2023: DKK 21.3m). Aside from liabilities recognised in the balance sheet, no significant losses are expected to be incurred as a result of contractual obligations.

Joint taxation
The Group is jointly taxed with the Danish entities within the Treville X Partners Group, with Treville X Partners ApS as the administrative company. The Group is, together with the other Danish companies in the Treville X Partners Group, liable for corporate taxes and withholding taxes on dividends, interests and royalties.

Pledged assets
A letter of indemnity (company charge) of nominal DKK 30.0m (2023: DKK 30.0m) has been deposited by the Group as security for the Group's bank debt.
Bank debt is secured by a mortgage of nominal DKK 25.0m deposited by the Group on assets, including the Group's goodwill, leasehold rights, furniture, including store furniture (2023: DKK 25.0m).
The foreign-owned entities' bank debt is secured by mortgages on their movable equipment and inventory of a total nominal amount of DKK 23.5m (2023: DKK 20.2m).

5.5 Events after the Reporting Period
Following the end of the 2024 financial year, significant events have taken place that will influence the Group's future strategic direction and financial structure:
In February 2025, a new Board of Directors was appointed, marking a key transition in corporate governance. As part of this change, Treville appointed board members stepped down from the Board. In the beginning of June 2025, the Executive Management, with the support of the banks, completed a management buy-out ("MBO"), ultimately obtaining a majority ownership of the Company.
As part of the MBO, the Executive Management and the banks have agreed to redesign the Group's capital structure through an equity contribution amounting to DKK 1,390m of which DKK 1,240m will be used to settle a portion of the former debt while DKK 150m will be contributed to strengthen the overall liquidity of the Group. The contributions will take place by mid of June 2025. Further, loans from prior shareholders of DKK 225m have been forgiven in connection with the change of ownership thus further reducing the Group's debt and improving equity.




The above contributions exceed the reported negative equity of the Group at 31 December 2024 of DKK 1,379m.
The remaining interest-bearing debt after completing the contributions mid of June 2025 amounts to DKK 1,185m. The maturities of the remaining interest-bearing debt have been agreed to be extended and will expire in June 2028, with a more favourable interest profile and no instalments due before June 2028.
The new capital structure will result in a positive equity of the parent company Zebra A/S and the Group's equity is also expected to be positive at the end of 2025. It provides the Group with a solid and resilient financial platform, enabling future growth initiatives and reinforcing management's commitment to the long-term success of the business.
No other events have occurred after 31 December 2024 that materially affect the consolidated financial position.

1.1 
Material Accounting Policies
Accounting policies
The financial statements for Zebra A/S have been prepared in accordance with IFRS(r) Accounting Standards as adopted by the EU, as well as Danish disclosure requirements applying to companies of reporting class C (large). Zebra A/S is a public limited company registered in Denmark.
The Parent Company generally applies the same accounting policies for recognition and measurement as the Group. Cases in which the Parent Company´s accounting policies differ
from those of the Group are described below. For a detailed specification of the Parent Company´s accounting policies, please see note 1.1 to the consolidated financial statements.

Cases in which the Parent Company´s accounting policies differ from those of the Group
Foreign currency translation
Currency adjustments of receivables from, or payables to, subsidiaries which are considered part of the Parent Company´s total investment in the relevant subsidiary are recognised in
the statement of profit or loss as financial income or financial expenses. In the consolidated financial statements, the currency adjustment is recognised in other comprehensive income.




Investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures in the Parent Company's financial statements
Investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures are measured at cost in the Parent Company's financial statements. If cost exceeds the recoverable amount of the investments, the investments are written down to such lower amount.
In connection with the sale of investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures, profits or losses are calculated as the difference between the fair value of the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the investments sold.

Reserve for capitalised development costs
In accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, the Parent Company has established a non-distributable reserve in equity covering development costs capitalised in 2016 and later, less amortisation and tax.

Implementation of new or amended standards and interpretations
Please refer to note 1.1 to the consolidated financial statements.



1.2 Significant Accounting Estimates and Judgments

















Unutilised credit facilities for the Parent Company amounted to DKK 325.8m at 31 December 2024 (2023: DKK 243.7m). The cash flow cannot be derived directly from the statement of profit or loss and the balance sheet.

Executive Management regards the following as significant accounting estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Parent Company's financial statements:

Recoverable amount of investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures
All subsidiaries and joint ventures of the Group are considered independent cash-generating entities. If there is any indication of impairment of the carrying amount (cost) of investments in subsidiaries or joint ventures, the impairment loss is determined based on the calculation of the value-in-use of the relevant entity.
If dividends distributed exceed the comprehensive income of the relevant entity for the period for which the dividend is distributed, this is considered an indication of impairment. Write-downs of goodwill attributable to a subsidiary or a joint venture that are recognised in the consolidated financial statements are also considered an indication of impairment.

Dispute with the Parent Company's freight forwarder From June 2021 to May 2022, the Parent Company's former freight forwarder charged sea freight rates above those that were contractually agreed. The Parent Company initiated legal proceedings before the Danish Maritime and Commercial High
Court ("Sø- og Handelsretten") on 1 March 2022. In August 2024, the dispute was settled out of court.

Other significant accounting estimates, assumptions and uncertainties
For a description of other significant accounting estimates, assumptions and uncertainties, please refer to note 1.2 to the consolidated financial statements.

Accounting policies
The Parent Company designs and purchases goods for the Group and sells the goods to all the Group entities. Sales are recognised when control of products has transferred upon delivery to the Group entity. Delivery occurs when the goods have been shipped from the central warehouses.
Revenue is recognised based on the price specified in the invoice. No element of financing is deemed present as the sales are made with a credit term of mainly 14 days.
A receivable is recognised when the goods are delivered. Please refer to note 3.5 for information on receivables from subsidiaries and recognition of impairment losses.
The Parent Company operates the Group's retail stores in Denmark.


Revenue from franchisees is recognised when control of the products has been transferred to the franchisees. Transfer of control of the products occurs when the products have been delivered to the franchise partner and no further obligation exists that can affect the transfer of control.
Delivery has taken place when the franchise partner has collected the products from one of the Parent Company's central warehouses. Revenue from the sale is recognised based on the price specified in the contract. The payment terms for the franchise partners are 14-30 calendar days from franchisee's receipt of such invoices. The price is not adjusted for any financing elements as payment terms never exceed 12 months. A receivable is recognised when the goods are delivered.
Except for damage claims, the franchisees have no rights of return. The figures below include franchise fees and royalties of
DKK 49.3m (2023: DKK 26.2m).

Significant accounting estimates and judgments
The Parent Company recognises deferred tax assets, including the expected tax value of tax losses carried forward, if the Executive Management assesses that these tax assets can
be offset against positive taxable income within the Parent Company's budgeting period that exceeds realisation of deferred tax liabilities. The Executive Management assesses tax assets and liabilities at least annually based on dialogue with tax advisors and business plans for the coming years, including other planned commercial initiatives.


The Executive Management considers it probable that an amount of DKK 76.9m (2023: DKK 40.7m) in tax assets can be offset against positive taxable income in the near future. An amount
of DKK 509.6m (2023: DKK 473.7m) in tax assets was impaired at year-end 2024. The impairment had a negative effect on profit or loss of DKK 35.9m in 2024 (2023: a negative effect of DKK 57.7m). The tax asset is impairment tested in relation to expected income for the period 2025 to 2031.
However, the amount of tax assets not shown in the balance sheet can still be carried forward to be offset against future taxable income after the budgeting period. Of the total deferred tax assets recognised, DKK 52.5m (2023: DKK 28.5m) is related to tax loss carry-forwards.















Effective tax rate adjusted for non-taxable income from investments in subsidiaries is 12.3% (2023: 46.9%).

Accounting policies
Investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures are measured at cost in the Parent Company's financial statements. If cost exceeds the recoverable amount of the investments, the investments are written down to such lower amount.
In connection with the sale of investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures, profits or losses are calculated as the difference between the carrying amount of the investments sold and the fair value of the sales proceeds.

Significant accounting estimates and judgments
The impairment test of investment in subsidiaries is based on value-in-use (discounted cash flow method) using projected EBITDA's for the period 2025-2029. An assumed growth
rate of 1% has been applied for the period 2030-2034. The country specific pre-tax WACC is in the range of 10.7%-17.3% (2023: 11.2%-15.8%). The impairment test showed a need for impairment of five entities in 2024 (2023: two entities were impaired). In 2024 impairment losses of DKK 112.4m were recognised (2023: DKK 0). No prior year impairment losses have been reversed in 2024 (2023: DKK 192.8m).

Zebra Japan K.K.
Joint venture investments in 2024 and 2023 consisted of the investment in Zebra Japan K.K., which promotes and sells products from Flying Tiger Copenhagen on the Japanese market.
The carrying amount of the investment is tested annually for impairment. The impairment test did not show any need for impairment losses to be recognised in 2024 (2023: DKK 17.0m).
The applied assumptions are disclosed in note 3.4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

DKKm

Investment in subsidiaries

joint ventures	Total

Accounting policies
Receivables from subsidiaries consist of receivables from trade as well as intercompany loans and cash pools. Receivables are measured at amortised cost less expected lifetime credit losses. The maximum credit risk is equal to the gross receivables, as the Parent Company has no collateral security.
The expected loss rates are based on days past due and whether a receivable concerns the sale of goods or a loan. Current expectations and estimates of expected credit losses are furthermore based on historical impairment rates, changes in debtor behaviour, and current economic conditions.
Expected credit losses are based on an individual assessment of each receivable and at portfolio level. Additionally, the current macroeconomic situation is characterised by a high degree of uncertainty and caution due to ongoing geopolitical tensions. The consequences of rising inflation rates and rising prices are taken into account when estimating future losses.
Receivables written off during the reporting period are still subject to enforcement activity.
Impairment losses relating to trade receivables are deducted from the carrying amount and are recognised in the statement of profit or loss in the separate line 'Impairment loss and reversal of impairment loss on receivables from subsidiaries'. Impairment losses relating to intercompany loans are deducted from the carrying amount and are recognised in the statement of profit or loss under financial expenses.


Intercompany balances, which are expected to be settled as part of the normal operating cycle are classified as current assets, unless an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period exists.

Significant accounting estimates and judgments
If a subsidiary's financial conditions deteriorate, further impairment losses may be required in future periods. In assessing the adequacy of expected credit losses, the Executive Management analyses receivables, including overdue debt, current economic conditions and changes in debtor payment behaviour.
The assessment of expected lifetime credit losses on receivables from subsidiaries resulted in recognition of an impairment loss in 2024 of DKK 16.3m (2023: DKK 0.1m). The impairment losses in 2024 relate to intercompany receivables from five entities (2023: three entities). In 2024, an amount of DKK 9.5m (2023: DKK 5.5m) regarding previous years' provisions was reversed, as the outstanding intercompany amount was no longer considered impaired.

Due between (days)

The provision for write-downs in the Group has been constructed to reflect that write-downs materialise in the local companies except for the provision related specifically to Zebra A/S.
The Executive Management has considered the recoverability of the inventory value and has recognised inventory write-downs of DKK 20.1m during 2024 (2023: DKK 38.5m). The decline in write- downs is due to a healthier stock situation and buying deeper into known top-sellers, resulting in a lower inventory risk.

The reversal of DKK 2.1m (2023: DKK 7.0m) in write-down provisions is driven by products being life-extended and re-introduced in the stores.

5.3 Guarantee Commitments and Contingent Liabilities	5.4 Events after the Reporting Period


Legal disputes
In 2025, the Parent Company received a preliminary decision from the Danish Tax Agency regarding Danish excise taxes for plastic and paper bags (Emballageafgiftsloven) for the years 2018 to 2024. The Danish Tax Agency states in their opinion that the Parent Company should pay an additional amount of
DKK 7.1m in excise taxes. This amount is expensed in Special Items in the statement of profit or loss. The final claim may increase due to interest and potential penalties. The Parent Company is disputing the claim by the Danish Tax Agency.

Litigations
A few legal proceedings and claims still pending are not expected to result in significant losses for the Parent Company, other than what has been provided for in the financial statements.

Other guarantees
The Parent Company has provided a guarantee to the Japanese joint venture's bank amounting to a maximum of DKK 62.8m (2023: DKK 69.2m). At 31 December 2024, the guaranteed amount constituted DKK 62.8m (2023 DKK 69.2m).
The Parent Company has guaranteed or provided guarantees for banking facilities, lease liabilities, etc. for subsidiaries amounting to DKK 45.3m (2023: DKK 43.9m).
The Parent Company has assessed the fair value of the issued financial guarantees and the subsequent potential loss allowance arising from same. Based on an assessment of the probability of a cash outflow resulting from the issued financial guarantees, the Parent Company has assessed the probability to be minimal and not recognised the issued financial guarantees in the balance sheet. The disclosed guarantees represented the potential maximum cash outflow resulting from the issued guarantees.


The Parent Company has also provided sureties for debts in certain subsidiaries amounting to a total of DKK 130.0m (2023: DKK 130.0m). Furthermore, the Parent Company has provided the banks extending the credit facilities with a preference for receivables in certain subsidiaries, amounting to a maximum of DKK 20.0m (2023: DKK 20.0m).
The Parent Company has issued letters of support in favour of certain subsidiaries.
Contractual obligations
Contractual obligations related to service contracts amounted to DKK 28.6m (2023: DKK 14.5m). Aside from liabilities recognised in the balance sheet, no significant losses are expected to be incurred as a result of contractual obligations.

Joint taxation
The Parent Company is jointly taxed with the Danish entities within the Treville X Partners Group, with Treville X Partners ApS as the administrative company. The Parent Company is, together with the other Danish companies in the Treville X Partners Group, liable for corporate taxes and withholding taxes on dividends, interests and royalties.

Pledged assets
A letter of indemnity (company charge) of nominal DKK 30.0m (2023: DKK 30.0m) has been deposited by the Parent Company as security for the Parent Company's bank debt.
Bank debt is secured by a mortgage of nominal DKK 25.0m deposited by the Parent Company on assets, including the Parent Company's goodwill, leasehold rights and furniture (2023: DKK 25.0m).
The carrying amount of pledged assets is stated below:

Following the end of the 2024 financial year, significant events have taken place that will influence the Parent Company's future strategic direction and financial structure:
In February 2025, a new Board of Directors was appointed, marking a key transition in corporate governance. As part of this change, Treville appointed board members stepped down from the Board. In the beginning of June 2025, the Executive Management, with the support of the banks, completed a management buy-out ("MBO"), ultimately obtaining a majority ownership of the Company.
As part of the MBO, the Executive Management and the banks have agreed to redesign the Parent Company's capital structure through an equity contribution amounting to DKK 1,390m
of which DKK 1,240m will be used to settle a portion of the former debt while DKK 150m will be contributed to strengthen the overall liquidity of the Parent Company. The contributions will take place by mid of June 2025. Further, loans from prior shareholders of DKK 225m have been forgiven in connection with the change of ownership thus further reducing the Parent Company's debt and improving equity.

The above contributions exceed the reported negative equity of the the Parent Company at 31 December 2024 of DKK 760m.
The remaining interest-bearing debt after completing the contributions mid of June 2025 amounts to DKK 1,185m.
The maturities of the remaining interest-bearing debt have been agreed to be extended and will expire in June 2028, with a more favourable interest profile and no instalments due before June 2028.
The new capital structure will result in a positive equity of the Parent Company. It provides the Parent Company with a solid and resilient financial platform, enabling future growth initiatives and reinforcing management's commitment to the long-term success of the business.

The Board of Directors and the Executive Management have today discussed and approved the annual report of Zebra A/S for the financial year 2024.
The annual report has been prepared in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards as adopted by the EU and further disclosure requirements required according to the Danish Financial Statements Act.
It is our opinion that the consolidated financial statements and the Parent Company's financial statements give a true and fair view of the Group's and the Parent Company's financial position at 31 December 2024, the results of the Group and Parent Company's operations and cash flows for the financial year
1 January - 31 December 2024.

In our opinion, the Management review includes a fair review of the development in the Group's and the Parent Company's
operations and financial conditions, the results for the year, cash flows and financial position as well as a description of the most significant risks and uncertainty factors that the Group and the Parent Company face.
We recommend that the annual report be approved at the annual general meeting.

To the shareholders of Zebra A/S
Opinion
We have audited the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements of Zebra A/S for the financial year 1 January - 31 December 2024, which comprise income statement, statement of comprehensive income, balance sheet, statement of changes in equity, cash flow statement and notes, including material accounting policy information, for the Group and the Parent Company. The consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements are prepared in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards as adopted by the EU and additional requirements of the Danish Financial Statements Act.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Group and the Parent Company at 31 December 2024 and of the results of the Group's and the Parent Company's operations and cash flows for the financial year 1 January - 31 December 2024 in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards as adopted by the EU and additional requirements of the Danish Financial Statements Act.

Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) and additional requirements applicable in Denmark. Our responsibilities under those standards and requirements are further described in the "Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements and the parent company financial statements" (hereinafter collectively referred to as "the financial statements") section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Independence
We are independent of the Group in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code) and the additional ethical requirements applicable in Denmark, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the IESBA Code.
Statement on the Management's review
Management is responsible for the Management's review.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the Management's review, and we do not express any assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the Management's review and, in doing so, consider whether the Management's review is materially inconsistent with the financial statements, or our knowledge obtained during the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
Moreover, it is our responsibility to consider whether the Management's review provides the information required under the Danish Financial Statements Act.
Based on our procedures, we conclude that the Management's review is in accordance with the financial statements and
has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Danish Financial Statements Act. We did not identify any material misstatement of the Management's review.

Management's responsibilities for the financial statements Management is responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements and parent company financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with IFRS Accounting Standards as adopted by the EU and additional requirements
of the Danish Financial Statements Act and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, Management is responsible for assessing the Group's and the Parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements unless Management either intends to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Auditor's responsibilities for
the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance as to whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and additional requirements applicable in Denmark will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.

resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations or the override of internal control.
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's and the Parent Company's internal control.
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by Management.
Conclude on the appropriateness of Management's use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's and the Parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group and the Parent Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
